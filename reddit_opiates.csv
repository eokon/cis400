"Well, let me preface this by saying that I have an extremely strong sales background (sold cars, and later insurance, for the better part of a decade) and that is the only reason my particular business model works for me. I'm CISSP and CEH certified but honestly, certs don't mean shit and are only there to look good for clients/employers. I do penetration testing of all sorts. I basically find companies that either have trade secrets or hold some type of personal information (hospitals are a great example because if there is a breach of data they can be held accountable through HIPPA laws) and I pitch a pentest to them. I talk about the various ways it can be done (myself being treated like a new employee and seeing what I can accomplish with basic access, being a complete outsider and seeing what I can accomplish, attacking one of their assets, (like a website) from the open net and seeing what sort of damage can be done (damage in the form of leaked personal info, etc).

Nothing I said was untrue, and I already said originally that opiates can affect people in different ways. I'm speaking for the majority of people, from personal experience.

"Same same. People will always say it's just the addiction talking but opiates turn me into a normal functioning person. Before opiates, I was always looking for something to feel better. I tried different supplements, different diets, exercised and kept journals. But ever since I can remember, I wished that I could just have a normal brain that worked like everyone else's. Even as a child, it was clear I was different. 

Finally saw a mental health specialist after my second child was born. Got put on stupid Zoloft, with a handful of Ativan every couple months if I was lucky. Otherwise, it was handouts on meditation and whatever else, as though I hadn't tried everything in the past decade plus. 

Well, I hadn't tried opiates. I had had them, but only when I was already in a good place, and very limited and recreationally. Once I tried them during a more stressful situation, I was sold. It didn't make me numb or inappropriately calm -- It made me feel the way everyone else had always seemed to feel during those moments. I felt emotions without them completely overtaking me and causing panic. I could live in the moment without obsessing over every possible outcome.

In my experience, along with what I've read from every other person, the half life is definitely lower than buccal/sublingual but only by about 25% or so. Obviously there's variations in this because of people switching between sublingual and IV, metabolism, missing shots ect.

Just think about. There's a couple easy ways to confirm the HL. First of all urine detection time. Bupe can easily stay in your system for 7 days. Morphine metabolites of heroin will be out by 3-4 days. Also full bupe wd doesn't really get started until almost 72hrs and the acute phase can last nearly two weeks. Where as someone who would be similarly maintained on an equivalent heroin dose would begin having wd symptoms within 12 hours.

"In 2013 when we had one of those big snow/ice storms near Atlanta I was working as a manager at a Pizza restaurant. All my fellow employees and even the owner had long since abandoned ship to escape before the storm hit, and I was running the store by myself. I planned on filling the last few orders then closing early and trying to meet up with my guy. I was driving an 09 Nissan Maxima, which handled surprisingly well on the icy roads. After work, while waiting for the all-clear from my dude, I spent a good twenty minutes spinning circles and drifting around the huge parking lot in front of my store. Finally I head down. 30-40 miles per hour on solid ice for about 25 miles into Atlanta seems like absolutely nothing when you're going to pick up. Nothing will stand in our god damn way, especially not some puny ice catastrophe. I'd drive through an active volcano if there were blues on the other side. Anyways, so I finally arrived at my guy's house, encountering nothing but an easily-bypassable closed road, and of course, as I'm the only one dumb enough to drive through that shit, my guy needs a ride to go get some. What he did have, however, was 'his last one,' which he gave me 'for the drive.' FOR THE DRIVE!!! Nothing would distract me from completing my mission. Cruising effortlessly and skillfully over the ice, bathing in the warmth, enjoying passing people spinning their tires, clearly stuck, while I passed gracefully by, in the fucking zone. A few minor slips and skids later, I faced the long but thoroughly enjoyable journey back home, drifting and sliding around the roads, reveling in my freedom to do so without getting arrested.

i think there's a lot of personal issues with your buddy that's probably just as, if not more to blame than any amount of drugs.

"OxyC is like super high grade shimmery flake yayo without the heart palpitations. OxyM (opana) is more like a highly euphoric morphine experience.

"I am an RN. I worked in the ER when I first got out of nursing school, but since then I have been in Telemetry for the past 2 years. As medical providers we have these things called EHRs (electronic health records) basically your chart online. And in my state all of the records are connected. For example if you go into your primary care doc's office and he submits that he gave you so and so prescription it goes on your MAR another statewide thing for medication. 

How do the charts connect you may ask? Well if the doctor has admitting privileges usually his charts are connected with the nearest hospital. And hospitals are all connected in my state. 
If you want pain pills go to your primary care physician. Tell him you have chronic pain, bring some kind of evidence. Tell him you have no physical dependence. Never ever say you're dependent! Tell the doctor your pain level is at least a 7-8 all the time. Really play the pain thing. Next take his battery of tests. Tell him you do routinely take NSAIDs and tylenol maximum daily limit. Tell him it just isn't cutting it. The doctor will probably start you out on a mild opiate, ie: Codeine, tramadol, or hydrocodone. Take that for awhile. Comeback and tell him thats not working. And keep doing that till you get the kind of pill you want. 
Don't overdue it though, because if the doctor gets suspicious or fears for his license he is going to kick your ass over to the pain specialist who will try to reduce pain meds, and switch you to less euphoric narcotics.

"At least you agree its a matter of preference. The only thing we disagree on is dope being more of a health risk. That simply isn't true. If I weren't on mobile id provide the links. I don't own a computer at the moment. House was robbed. Heroin doesn't do any damage to your body, it certainly doesn't inherently cause any damage any other opiate does. As far as quality changing. It doesn't change for me. I always get the same stuff every time. Plus the majority of DNM vendors provide the same stuff every time. For cheaper than what I pay on the street, which is cheaper than pharmaceuticals by a huge margin.Its nice being able to agree with someone even though we have a different personal preference. Other than the health factor, I've done probably hundreds of hours of research. Im 100% confident that im correct. Opiates haven't been found to be harmful. Not heroin nor any pharmaceutical.The quality thing is like me saying well sometimes you can get robbed buying oxy. Its neither an argument for or against. Its anecdotal. A good supplier is a good supplier. There is no arguing that heroin is the stronger opiate, much like morphine is stronger than oxy. Its just a fact.Edit: The only thing I would add is its only possible to have a personal preference if you have ample experience with both drugs. Not to say you cant prefer oral ROA. Its just I see people say the prefer one drug to other and tried the other. Sometime they have only had shit heroin which sucks not much can be done at that point, and there is no way to know the quality but least they are entitled to an honest preference. Not saying you have or haven't tried it. I've just encountered that before. It defeats the point of having the conversation. Some folks have their mind made up and will flat out deny facts.

Its amazing being able to just walk into a store and get something OTC that will keep you from being dope sick. Also, lope is an amazing potentiator if you don't have enough dope to get you high. So I hope that helps and there is a lot more info on lope in the Opiates info sidebar under withdrawal survivor guide. ",coteelp,opiates,1424613397,Darker_side_of_her,1,0

I know a lot of people disagree but that type is from the naloxone due to iving it. If you were to take it sublingually my guess is you wouldn't have any problems. The pwd I get is similar in intensity but is from the bupe and lasts at least 36 hrs. Try inducting with subutex iv and you won't experience the same discomfort. Bupe is stronger than naloxone but its uptake is slower. So it takes time before it replaces it on the receptor. Everyone likes to say the naloxone does nothing but that's not true for the first half hour or so of iv induction.,corwleh,opiates,1424469448,ProllyChris,2,0

See that's the thing about benzos... Maybe you shoulda slammed a smaller dose first then taken something less than a whole brick. Or just not mix em at all. 

I had to stop taking benzos cuz i dont trust myself not to go wild, same with alcohol. You know: do everything in sight, fuck the consequences. I remember one time My friend and i  passed out like you did, and when I woke up I found him choking on his own saliva with his eyeballs rolled back like a fucking demon. Me and my other homie called the ambos and they coached us through resuscitation. That was the longest 5 minutes of my life. We talked after, he said he got the rush then 2 seconds later me and my friend were standing over him and his chest hurt like hell from the pressure. It had been 2 hours in reality.  I think death woulda been similar, just without the waking up part.

Exactly. I made a loong post on /r/drugs when they were asking if opiates could be just an occasional thing. 

And yes, they can. But if you bring opiates into your life and have them around for years then there's a huge chance that you'll fuck up somehow down the line. Your willpower might be solid now, but could you guarantee it isn't going to slip, even just once, a few years down the line? Most people have no idea what their life situation will be in 3 years.

"yes methadone makes people fat, me included. its gradual. it doesn't happen all at once, it actually took a while before i stopped and noticed that i was fat. but honestly don't let that stop you. its mostly all water weight that you'll lose when you come off it. and if it really bothers you just try to eat healthy and exercise so it doesn't get bad.

we don't have oxymorphone here in canada so I'm going to check out what an equivalent dose in drugs that i do are. so uh according to [this site](http://www.opana.com/prescriber/dosing/opioid-conversions.aspx) you should be on about 120-140mg of methadone. of course you won't get that much at once but that's what this site says you need for a stable dose. again, everyone's bodies react differently, you might actually need a lot less or a lot more than that. as a reference, I was on 110mg for a long time. I'm at 60mg now but still using H.

i was trying to write this earlier when break was over so ill finish off what i was saying. its so much easier to try suboxone FIRST and then go on methadone if it doesn't work out. the reason is because since methadone is so long-acting, if you're on it you need to be off methadone for MINIMUM 72 hours for it to COMPLETELY leave your body. you need to be moderately sick to start the induction process. i had stopped taking my methadone A WEEK earlier (but i was using H, a short acting opiate, not to be sick during the week) and my induction went horribly. i did my last hit of H 24 hours before induction. they gave me 4mg. i started puking even more. i felt horrible. i wanted to give up and go home. another 4mg. i started feeling a bit better but i was SO anxious. stopped puking at some point. another 4mg and i felt slightly better but i felt so weak and so fucked up. i couldn't even walk straight. i was so dizzy. it was so cold. they sent me off home with a script. worked my way up to 20mg. was on sub for a week and a half. i woke up everyday having an anxiety attack. i just felt generally weak and not well. i barely eat for a week and a half. couldn't sleep. couldn't get comfortable in bed. it drove me nuts. i relapsed. went back on methadone. i spent 3 months going from 110ml to 40ml and straight from 40 to 0 for a week but i used 3p IV daily with no methadone.

but in '09 when i switched from H to suboxone the whole experience was GREAT. i did not get sick during my induction. i was well enough that i was able to go on with my day after leaving the clinic. i had a much smaller habit then. insufflation, 8mg dilaudid or one point of H, don't remember anymore. i went up to 8mg suboxone. my mistake was tapering too fast and living with H dealers. went down to 4mg in the span of maybe 3 months. started feeling sick when id go down. (takes about 2-3 days for you to feel the full effect when you change dose). i used twice during those 3 months before relapsing completely. the suboxone made me feel great. i never craved H except for when i started going down too fast. but at a stable dose you won't even want to do the 10g pile of H on the table. i honestly feel like an idiot for fucking that up for myself. it was actually WORKING!!!!

and you have to be at 40mg or lower (preferably lower) before they switch you from methadone to suboxone.

honestly its so much easier to just try sub first and if it doesn't work out go on methadone. there is a ceiling effect so if your habit is too high the sub might not cover you for 24 hours. but thats something you'll only find out by trying. since you only sniff that right there isn't as bad as IV'ing the amount you do. go see your doctor and ask him what kind of dose of sub you would need.

if the sub makes you sick people on this sub say it's because your dose is too high. theres a lot of ppl especially here that say less is more with sub. a symptom of taking too much is headaches.

"First and foremost even if you only use once and then never ever again in your life it is still, as you put it, a full blown relapse. For example if you have been clean for 10 years, if you just take a quarter of a pink one time and then never touch opiates again until you die, you still relapsed once. 

Now that that's out of the way.... based on my personal experience and what I have seen in other people I know, no, it is not really possible. I was clean for 5 years and got offered a blue by someone for free and I only going to do that blue, since it was free and it would just be rude to say no when someone is offering you free expensive drugs (plus I was just getting to know these people and there was a rumor going around I was a CI and they knew I use to be a pill head and my crazy mind thought it would look suspect if I said no). I was just going to do that blue and then nothing else because I had been clean for so long and had no desire to ever go back to the place I was before I got clean. Well that didn't work out at all. As soon as I felt that high again it was game over. I didn't start using every day again right away but within a few months I was. Just that once turned into every once in a while, turned into once a month, turned into twice a month, turned into once a week, turned into just on weekends, turned into the weekend includes Fridays once I got off work, turned into everyday but only once I got off work, turned into everyday all day. I have seen that same story happen with a lot of my friends and my husband so I know I'm not weird or unusual for that happening. Its not even like you intend for it to happen or really make the conscious choice for that to happen or that to be the case. It just kind of happens without you intending to or consciously choosing to. Opiate addiction is sneaky like that. To be clear I am not saying that to take responsibility off of myself for my habit it was completely my own fault, I chose to take the first drug and continued to choose to take them and cheat on my own rules I had made for myself but it can be very sneaky.

So if I were you I just wouldn't do it. If you are even asking this question it kind of seems like you know that if you use once it will turn into more than that. Especially since it is a court ordered thing. You wouldn't want to mess up your legal situation. Its so much easier to just not do it in the first place then to do it and end up having to clean up a big mess that it could (and probably will) create.

"When people first switch they often still prefer the oxy high. After a while most people tend to prefer dope from what I've seen. I would def make the switch as I don't think dope is any worse for you. I've seen people say its worse for you because you get so much more and therefore eventually get a much worse habit? When the oxy 80s first came out they were $15 on the block as nobody really knew what they were. So by this same reasoning a person against dope for its price would think 80 mg ir oxy for $15 is bad too?
I see a lot of people say that the switch to IV heroin was a bad choice and that they learned to regret it. I don't identify with that at all but maybe that's because its been so long since I've done it any other way. The only benefit of not IV'ing I can see is that you stay well for a little longer. Or if your dope or technique is shitty you can fuck up your veins but I've only lost one part of one vein from dope in over 15 years. My tolerance didn't go up anything crazy after IVing either.",cojrfgm,opiates,1423785228,ProllyChris,1,0

"We get benzos like valium 5 or 10, zopiclone ( lunenesta in the states) and lately xanax. 

I'm on my way into score now.  I'll pick up 14 zopiclone 7.5mgs for 10 euro and and half an eighth of gear for 50 euro. I'll neck 5 -7 zopiclone (although I always wake up with none)  and about 45 minutes later have a shot ( get about four outta the half eighth. 

Zopiclone and gear has been my preference for about 12 years now. Always together. I won't get either if I can't get the other. 
Luckily I've been on methadone (free in Ireland) for 15 years. I get 80mls (liquid) a day but only take 40. Pick it up once a week at my chemist. So that leaves me a little over 200 mls to sell for 50 euro every week.

And the past 6 years I've only been dabbling., scoring once a week.  Usually in the morning and it's gone the next. 

We don't see percs or vics or hydro over here.  Why would we. A lot of the drugs coming into Europe come in through Ireland because our security is shit.  Means we get gear from Afghanistan or packistan.  Cheap ( I'd pay 80-90 euro for 3.5grams) and reasonably good quality.  

I couldn't tell you what kind of powder it is # 3 or #4. You have to add citric acid to cook up or it won't break down.

I don't know if that is more common because of the bullshit legal situation in this country or some kind of self-bias either innate or brought on by the usage.

"Actually, I believe the shitty picture taken in the car was a different batch of heroin/crack. The heroin was darker but pretty much the same quality (it always is here), the crack however was better. The 2 better pictures have that soapy translucent looking crack, which was still pretty good. If I recall correctly the good pictures feature about 1.5g of heroin, and $100 slab of crack.
I'm not sure if other MI dopeheads would agree with me but I find heroin, as long as it's still rocked up, to pretty much always be of the same quality. Granted I've had some batches that varied, I've never done a regular sized shot and had my dick in the dirt, nor have I ever done a regular shot and been disappointed.
I have noticed some different effects though. A few times I got shit in Lower Michigan that gave me these weird headaches, and also made me more nauseous than normal. The one time the dope was really dark, like mud looking shit, with black specs. The other time it just looked like regular dope.
Got some shit through my friend's connect (my regular connects ""cousin"") and it was this really light colored shit (similar the the color of the dope in the 2 pictures) except it was kind of soft/wet/clumpy. Gave me a crazy pins and needles burn in my face/hands. The people I was with claimed it to be better than the regular shit but I found the actual quality to be the same. Shit like that sometimes leads people to think the dope is better, the same way that coke cut with lidocaine sometimes makes people think it's bomb shit simply because it makes them really numb.

Note: I don't actually have a habit. I have a retarded ass tolerance and couldn't afford a dope habit for the life of me. I can run through a gram in a night. Usually no matter how much I buy, even if it's 2 grams, I only wake up the next day with one mild shot left.
Love the speedballs though, I'm not super huge into the coke IV rush like my ex-gf, I only like to do 1-3 shots of crack then I'm fuckin' done. Crack/coke is really expensive in my area though, I typically shoot $10-$20 worth, $20 is a fucking bellringer for me. Back in the day a $6 or $7 shot of coke was a bellringer though. Usually when I cop I spend about 85% on dope and 15% on crack. Like if I buy a gram and half of dope for $200 I'll get a $30-$40 rock to go with it.",cosyfh4,opiates,1424564612,valuum,3,0

I've also got ECP thats better than 99% of the tar I've had. If I had to compare the best bth to the best ecp I've had it would probably be a tie. Since I don't bang anymore I prefer ECP these days because I can snort it and don't really like smoking bth. But if I was still shooting I'd choose tar since it tends to so much cheaper.

Yeah, so I've had numerous times in my life where I felt as hopeless as you seem to be in your post. I've literally wrote things exactly like that. I can seriously empathize with you to an extreme degree. However, today I'm 11 months clean! I have a job. A car. An apartment. I seriously never once thought I could come this far.

You honestly sound depressed to me. Which I can understand that is a side affect of withdrawal, but you said you were clean for 9 months &amp; still you weren't 100%. Maybe you should see if depression is causing you to feel that way while yr clean. 

I know I didn't feel 100% after 9 months, but I def felt good about life. Right now I'm pretty much dancing on my heels, so ecstatic with life. I missed everyone around here tho!

Meth is really fucking awesome the first few times but after that, your body gets used to it and if you keep using tolerance sets in fast. Keep hydrated and eat, sleep when you can unless you wanna see/hear stuff it's not too bad.

Knowing when psychosis has set in is tough, specifically delusions of grandeur, because it feels right when you're famous, smart, and everyone loves you. Should have a trusted person tell you if you're acting weird.

For myself i would say i had a ""JJ"" moment 2 summers ago, it was on or around my birthday and i had a bottle of about 25 30mg oxycodone IR and i was fucked up that night driving around meeting and talking to different people, so then I woke up the next morning and couldn't find the bottle anywhere for the life of me, had my friend over to help me look, check my car and drive around to the places i was thinking i might have dropped it Nothing. I'm like going nuts tearing my room apart thinking I hid it somewhere before i passed out and forgot where, so i never find the bottle and assume its gone, somebody i met w/ snagged it when i wasn't looking or i just dropped, didn't hear it fall and its gone.... So fast forward a month or two and i'm all out of jawns and franticly calling my two non addict best friends to see if they'll spot me money till tomorrow so i don't have to be sick for work in the morning, literally as i'm on the phone calling my  buddy almost begging him to spot me a hundred bucks till tomorrow i reach into my bathroom vanity cabinet and hear a telltale pill bottle rattle and i think no fucking way this is happening, I reach my hand in and pull out a beautiful bottle of 30 30mg M box oxy IR, i tell my friend never mind and hang up. I honestly could not believe that this just fucking happened, I didn't think i was really awake and this was a shitty drug dream and i'd wake up and be SOL.

"I saw the post about your brother and I'm very sorry. If I lost my brother I know a part of me would die with him and I'd never be the same. Luckily my bro has seen first hand what drugs have done to my life so he stays away from them. 

But I actually love the subs they keep my off opiates. But I started drugs for fun when I was young, now I figure I just trained my brain to need some sort of euphoria. 
I tried anti-depressants for a short time and stopped them.

As for the pain I'm trying to numb I suppose it started from grade school. Got made fun of a lot to the point where I began to hate myself and would self harm. I also have a speech impediment called a stutter so that made me further depressed since little kids can be assholes. Eventually traded depression for drugs. I no longer have depression just anxiety and the constant need to not be sober.

I made it this far because the suboxone kind of gave me the slight opiate buzz I needed. Now that it's faded with tolerance im taking whatever I can get my hands on. I hope I don't go back to heroin but I feel it's just one lucky occurrence of finding a connect away.  

Sorry for the long post but I'll answer one more question. ""Do I want to stop?"" I want to feel like I don't want to do drugs anymore. But I can't go back in time and stop me from  starting so sadly the answer is no. I want to want to stop but on the surface I feel too mentally far gone. Thank you for your concern.

"Oh I was sober from August 25th to thanksgiving of last year (so I guess 3 months almost exactly; never realized I'd made it that long until I just typed that out haha) 

And over the past decade I've been sober usually once or twice a year (not including weekends where I couldn't score or when I was too broke to get anything etc) for anywhere from 2 weeks to 3 or even 6 months, I think 6 months is definitely my longest. 

Now that I'm in my late 20s the novelty of L has definitely worn off although I still absolutely LOVE it. My brains seems to be telling me recently that it's more of an occasional treat rather than a regular experience. For example, I got a 10strip of my favorite shit ever 3 weeks ago. My BFF was in town and she's one of a very few people with this guys number. I've partied with him and gone to Bonaroo with him a couple times in the same camping group, but he is beyonnnnnnnd overly-protective with his phone number, I'd imagine fewer than 50 people have ever even dialed it

But, he is the son of one of a certain mr. Garcia's original house cooks and has kept the family business strong lol. This shit is BOMB to the point that I really don't even care to try and find any other stuff. The last time I had it was last March when we went to a festival in Phoenix with sound tribe, disco biscuits, gramatik, lettuce, and a few other awesome acts as well as fucking dispatch- it was such a beautiful desert trip!!!!!!

But after that I had no desire to do any for forever. Then my friend came to town and she was getting some hash oil from him anyway, and while she was in the car with him she called me and asked if I wanted a 10strip for $__ (an incredibly low and amazing price, like enough of a good price that I wish I'd had enough on me to get a damn sheet of it tbh)

So it's chillin in my rainbow ""San Francisco"" wallet, cut up into 10 tiny little pieces, each in their own foil and own baggy, in a dark corner of a dark drawer haha. As recently as this week my brain flipped the switch from ""no acid"" to ""yes please."" Very suddenly lol

Im thinking about taking a hit rn and just tripping my nuts off all night. I don't have to see or speak to anyone in the morning, and have plenty of music/movies/paper/markers/writing utensils to keep me occupied (I get really creative if im tripping in a setting that is kinda limited, aka my house on a Sunday night lmao). I prob wouldn't feel such an urgent desire for it, but on Wednesday they're pretty much replacing my whole ankle joint and I won't be able to walk until April. So def no tripping during that lol. I wish I had someone to share this shit with, it's seriously the dankest L I've ever had and I've been lucky enough to get my hands on some a good 10-15 times in my life because two of my very good friends from college are homegirls with dude and he always hooks them up.

"Everyone seems like a cool and solid guy when you are giving them $1500. Good luck with that. I truly hope he doesn't burn you but you need to expect to get burned. Its better than counting on it and it not coming. So make all your decisions and planning as if you will never see it again. That way it doesn't affect you when it doesn't come, and if it actually does its just extra. Your decision making is so terrible. You need to figure out what you need to do to change that. Manage your dope habit, don't let people take advantage of you the whole nine. You make it impossible to even feel bad for you. This is one of those cases where you have to learn the hard way. You are unfortunately beyond the help of others currently. If you start working on it now you can get into rehab and the sober living after for free. That way you aren't homeless at all and can work on rebuilding your life. That is the honest best advice you are going to get from anyone. No one is going to bail you out because it would be a complete waste at this point in your life. Even that one guy who helps people pay rent and bills would pass on this one. He might help you into a rehab but that's all he would do, if that even. Sorry for being blunt and honest.  I wish you the best.

"&gt;Florida passed the law in 2011 that physicians must test patients (2) times a year to see that the medicine prescribed are in the patient's system and or illegal drugs, because these laws are not mandated in nature it's to the physicians discretion.

I find that to be tested twice a year to be more than fair.  I have absolutely no problem with being tested twice a year.  Hell, I wouldn't care if they tested me every time that I came in for a refill because I have absolutely nothing to hide from them.

The two instances where my urine came back ""inconsistent"" were to be expected and I even warned them ahead of time that it would happen.  In fact, the two ""inconsistent"" occurrences only took place because I was following the orders of other doctors.  

1. The first ""inconsistent"" occurrence took place because I was in the E.R., and eventually admitted to the hospital, due to *Acute Bronchitis* as well as *Severe Upper Respiratory Infection*.  When I was discharged from the hospital, my oxygen levels were still not 100% so my discharge orders were to stop taking all opiate pain medication due to the complications that occur ordinarily with opiates and breathing;throwing *Acute Bronchitis* and *Severe Respiratory Infection* in there is almost asking for disaster.  **This is one of the instances that had my urine as ""inconsistent""**
2. The second ""inconsistent"" occurrence took place when I was back on my pain medications but I was at the follow up with my Primary Care Physician and I still had a horrendous cough.  He prescribed me some CherritussanAC.  It's basically Guanifesen plus Codeine.  My Primary Care Physician suggested that I lay off the pain medications again because I would be taking the Codeine (which is another opiate).  Yes, I know it's a low-strength opiate compared to what I'm taking but we didn't want to take any chances.  Even still, I didn't stop taking my other medications completely.  I just stopped taking them as often as I had been.  So now the urine test came back with my usual medications plus Tramadol, plus Codeine, plus Hydrocodone.  I showed them the prescriptions I had for the Codeine as well as the Tramadol.  They asked me ""Does your Primary Care Physician know that you're taking these narcotics as well?""  I laughed and said ""He should as he was prescribing them to me before you guys were.""  And with all of that, I still have absolutely no idea where the Hydrocodone came from.  I have no reason to lie on here.  I honestly have no idea why it was in my system.

&gt;In another words unless your doctor has had a recent records audit (not a good thing) then the drug test results don't have to be sent in or preserved. So your doctor like most test you at your appointment (HELL everybody's out of meds then) correct ?

Well, I guess yeah, everyone is out of their meds on refill day but you should still have them in your system.  If you've been taking your medications correctly, they should still be in your system for up to 4 to 5 days after you've stopped taking them.

&gt;90 15mg roxy (3 times a day) is considered a safe-max dosage on a month to month basis or comprehensively. Doctors want you to be honest if they can't handle it move on, they need to trust you with the meds.

Okay.  But I have been on 120 15mg Roxy (4 times a day) for the passed 3 years.  Safe-max dosage or not.  There is absolutely no reason for her to have changed my dosage.  In fact, we had talked about possibly upping some of my other medications or changing some of my other medications because the Oxycodone wasn't being as effective as it had been.  And my doctor can and does trust me with my medications.  It's only this stupid physician's assistant that I had only seen once or twice that got her panties in a bunch over nothing.  And I probably will be moving on because if I have to deal with this bullshit every time I see this woman, my life is going to be living hell and I can't fucking take this shit happening because she wants to change my medications on a whim again.",codyl42,opiates,1423301485,SpecialSause,2,0

" I do around 5 pills a day. Sometimes more, rarely less as of late. I mostly do half pill shots (4mg) and the occasional whole shot. It's ridiculously expensive and just ridiculous over all.  And yes, pretty much every two hours. The longer gaps are when I'm sleeping. And I do wake up in the middle of the night sick. Honestly less is more with the number of shots you are doing when it comes to dilaudid. It's best to wait 3-5 hours between to really feel the rush, which is the whole point of shooting ds. I enjoyed it much more when I was doing 4-6 shots a day. What happens now is I'm caught in this cycle where I don't wait long enough so I don't feel a good rush and then because I'm not satisfied I am fiending for my next shot immediately and I don't wait long enough so I don't feel a good rush...

Where im from, the radical/violently anti-gay and most homophobic people tend to be drunken rednecks and religious zealots.

I also don't ""act gay"" so it's also always 100% my choice who knows im gay if it is our first time meeting, so I also don't know what that part of the plight is like.

Best way is to just tell your doc you get diarrhea sometimes for no reason and you've had lomotil in the past. Then when you get the initial rx, just keep calling the pharmacy to refill it. Of course they'll tell you there are no refills on it and they'll ask if you want them to call the doctor and ask.

"I think that if I ever did have kids, I would want to sober up for them. I grew up in a household of meth cooks and to say the least my childhood was very fucked up. My parents used to have me and the other children of their fellow cooks play lookouts when they thought that the drug task force was after them. They trained us to look out for any suspicious cars, especially plain white vans and cops cars, both marked and unmarked. It was all fun and games as a 7 year old but thinking back on it shit was really messed up. I can't even count how many times we would go out two these two trailers in the middle of no where, the kids/women had one trailer and the other one was off limits. I have been told once I was older that the other trailer was a lab that they used for years before it got busted.

I remember my dad being very sick and almost dying from a mixture of an overdose and cotton fever. It was scary as shit and I didn't quite understand what had made him so sick. When I was about 10 my dad went to prison and did 7 years for a class x felony manufacturing charges (this was in the mid 90's before they really started cracking down on meth) Around 6 months after he left, my mom was arrested for possession and did about a year in the county. Me and my two siblings were left with our 70 yr old grandmother to raise us for the bulk of the years my dad was in prison. It was infinitely better once she took over but still, children need their parents. 

Growing up in a situation like that really opened my eyes, and no matter how much I hated drugs of all kinds as a small child, we all know things change and now here I am, addicted to heroin. Now I don't put the blame for my use on anyone but myself, I knew exactly what I was getting into when I did my first line of dope. While I still love my parents and once they sobered up they provided for us as best as they could with honest work, I wouldn't want to put my own child through the type of life I had to live. I don't even know if I want kids at this point in my life but you never know. 

I just want to thank you for this post, typing all of this out brought to mind some things that I hadn't thought about in years. I look forward to your other posts throughout the coming weeks.

But yeah, that's just the way that things are done here. It's a pretty stupid way compared to the street dealing in the US where there are sometimes a team working with a lookout etc.

I was in London though a couple of years ago, and bought some crack on the streets, and they were working as an organised team. Hand one guy the money, he signals across the street, who signalled to someone else who then came over with the gear.

But in Scotland anyway, dealers are just lazy bastards who sit in their house all day and let people come to them. It makes it very fucking obvious though that they're dealing. Busts are common.",coc2h1r,opiates,1423150868,knuckles1978,3,0

2) your bf is does not respect you. he told you hurtful things, did not reassure you. without respect there is no relationship.

disrespect, hurtfulness, guilt trips = bullshit

talk with him. a relationship without communication is a ticking time bomb. let him know your fears, concerns. tell him in a way that is not accusatory.

"Yep definitely takes longer than oxycodone. See, oxyC has a pretty short half life for opiates, as well as having lower binding affinity. Bupeprenorphine/suboxone, on the other hand, has an extremely long half life, as well as a super super high binding affinity. So the suboxone is so strong on your brain's receptors that it stays there nice and long, preventing something with less binding affinity, like oxyC, from even getting into the brain. That would be higher doses of bupe to *completely* render oxy useless, but 2mg three days in a row, you'd def need more oxy than normal to feel anything.

"Let me propose an alternative hypothesis to the (mis/over)-quoted idea that hydrocodone isn't good intranasal, and let's disregard filler for a moment. 

First, as the most prescribed painkiller in the United States, it makes no sense for high BA numbers be reported at all. Second, I have never seen a reliable BA number for hydrocodone reported; that is, a number without affiliation to a pharmaceutical company or anti-drug-backed laboratory. 

Next, let's make an assumption. When something is insufflated, a variable amount will bind to the hydrated surface that is the intranasal cavity. Some of this will diffuse into the bloodstream, and some amount will, due to any BA drug, permeate the BBB and trigger some release of DA and 5HT due to agonist properties at various receptors. The rest will ""drip"" into the stomach and permeate the stomach/small intestine and find its way to the liver for metabolism into *many* products. Some will, likely, permeate the BBB as hydrocodone; some will, again, be packaged as hydromorphone before its permeation; and, hell, some will be excreted via urine and other biologically applicable waste-producing mechanisms. 

I present you with two scenarios, and I ask to be picked apart. Examined will be a few categories.

Scenario 1: 30 mg consumed orally; 10 mg intranasal

* Time to active hydrocodone concentration: fast
* Time to active hydromorphone: medium
* Time to peak hydrocodone: medium (drip)
* Time to peak hydromorphone: medium  

Scenario 2: 40 mg consumed orally; 0 mg intranasal

* Time to active hydrocodone concentration: medium
* Time to active hydromorphone: medium
* Time to peak hydrocodone: medium 
* Time to peak hydromorphone: medium  

Even if the BA is only ~25% intranasal, the rapid onset (&lt;10 minutes) will be noticeable, and the overall concentration will be a medium amount. The overall quality of high can be argued day and night, and fillers **do** negatively affect the nasal cavity, but I can provide many qualitative experiences that intranasal hydrocodone (with filler) is biologically active much more quickly, and the overall quality of the high and its duration is unaffected. 

There are plenty of generalizations present in my post, but I will argue the time to active concentration as being an addictive quality. This is kind of the same idea behind cocaine and focailin. While they will both provide roughly the same DA binding and concentrations, when consumed orally, focalin takes anywhere from 15 - 30 minutes to reach this and cocaine is 2 - 5 minutes. Why is crack cocaine the most addictive substance (qualitatively) on the planet? The cocaine's full effects are strong within 30 seconds instead of 5 minutes, and this is notwithstanding equal concentrations of the affected monoamines, as crack will not have any magical binding qualities when compared to intranasal. 

Tl;dr intranasal hydrocodone works faster, and its overall high will, at worst, be equal to oral hydrocodone. Snorting shit with fillers isn't a good idea, but neither is abusing pills, so pick your poison and draw lines in the sand where **you** see fit -- not based on what I nor another person on the internet says. Also, it's just hydrocodone ;)",cohyknf,opiates,1423641075,ancientye,1,0

"I've had thoughts about death before any psychoactive drugs entered my system. Opiates are definitely not the blame here! I sometimes wish they were, because then I could formulate a cause-effect relation, in hopes I will have that information as a tool to combat this issue. Suicidal-anything sucks so much.

About the baking powder. I sprinkle a pinch of it in my bth shot to level the acidity so the shot won't burn as much. A tip I got from blue forums IIRC. It either has a placebo effect on me or it works, but bth shots don't burn as much anymore anyway. In all fairness, that used to be my MO. I usually throw the baking powder out whenever I decide to be clean, and I would usually be too lazy to get more of it whenever I start getting high again. And the last 1 or 2 shots of bth didn't burn. I don't shoot bth that much though -- it scares me. I don't know. It's probably pointless if not harmful.

Valium is usually good for treating this, klonopin is FDA approved for RLS, but I personally use Gabapentin. It is also FDA approved for RLS. So when detoxing, before I take subutex, (I wait 36 hours before using bupe) I use gabapentin, bromazepam, xanax, and pyrazolam (technically a RC chem but i believe its prescribed in a few countries, I think Greece is the country in which it is most prevalent). Lope is great for GI issues, also, I use Prilosec OTC or prescribed, to help settle the heartburn I get from throwing up, or from having no appetite and having stomach acid creeping up into my esophagus. My nicotine craving usually goes away when I quit opioids, and I find nicotine to irritate my symptoms as it is a CNS stimulant, and can counteract the sedative effects of aforementioned downers. It sounds like you have it covered, but trying to see a sub doctor might help you. I've seen two sub doctors, and both of them without any question scripted me 2mg xanax 3x daily, because I told them I had used it in the past and it really helped, and that I have a high tolerance to benzos. A couple xanax always helps me knock out for 4-6 hours. Especially if I'm on bupe. If you pay cash you can see a sub doctor out of your health network to keep other doctors from seeing you were treated for addiction. Good luck, I hope you feel better soon, and congratulations on taking the first step towards recovery. I also recommend AA, as the depression from quitting opioids can be overwhelming, having other people who have substance abuse problems there to support you is a big help.

You should be fine on the blood work though because they aren't testing for drugs most likely. They may, I've had that happen a couple times when they were only supposed to be doing routine blood work. You may have to just stick with illegal drugs and pass on the xanax script. Plus the doctor may not even prescribe it in the first place. They have to evaluate you and make the decision on their own. The therapist can give a recommendation but its far from a guarantee. You are more likely to get a non narcotic. I've seen them more likely to give kpins than xanax but that's after the non narcotics don't work.

"I had some 15 ago when I broke/sprained my ankle, back then I was brand new to any prescription drugs whatsoever. At first they prescribed a bottle of Tylenol + codeine, when that wasn't cutting it for my extreme pain, then they upped it to one or two bottles of Vicodin. The third time I asked for more they accused me of developing an addiction, and prescribed Ultram (back then it was still patented so no generics) because it was considered ""less addictive"" and told me that was the final pain medicine I was getting. I remember a mildly euphoric, classic opiate buzz that kicked in intermittently over the course of a few hours. The buzz reminded me of the codeine, but with less itchiness. Sometimes, though, I would usually start feeling pukey, ""weird"", or just plain tired and conch out for an hour, or all night long after like 100mg. I think I took it maybe like 3 or 4 times, and then I was so unimpressed I flushed the rest of the bottle. It was nothing special and I never asked for it nor desired it ever again. 

A few weeks ago, I saw a ""conservative"" doctor for treatment of a painful ear infection. He prescribed some generic Tramadol. Recalling my past experience with the broken ankle, I figured what the hell I'll take it a few times and then throw away the rest, just like last time. I took like 50mg + 50mg an hour later (I read somewhere it works better when spaced out a bit) and felt like I was rolling balls that day. Decent moderate level opiate buzz (kinda like Codeine), no amazeballs peaks like hyrdos or oxys though. I felt fucking great in a different way though- like just super happy. I think that's because Tramadol is literally some kind of weird mix between a weak opiate, a weak SSRI (Prozac), and a weak benzo (Valium)- scientists don't even fully understand how it really works. It took my pain away only slightly, but my mood was elevated, and I felt pretty fucked relaxed. I had the most vivid, colorful dreams all night long like weird fucked up movies. Food/munchies was slightly better, reading was slightly better, gaming was slight better, and I had amazing sex for like an hour. This time, no nausea or nothing, just a tiny bit of constipation and I had some depression for one or two days after I finished the bottle.

If you are not happy with our suggestions go back to the pain sub. And as far as going back and forth with the ER for fent patches forget about it.

I definitely agree that there needs to be a zero tolerance policy for any type of abuse when you have kids. Physical altercations are very rare but he thinks it is acceptable to call me crazy/bitch/junkie/etc in front of our 4 year old. He has gotten better since I made it clear I would not put up with that shit. But really, he's basically the opposite of the person I married in a lot of ways. Stress of having kids and a chronic illness I guess... I just never thought he could change so much. Sometimes I have dreams about the person he was a few years ago.

Sorry you had to deal with all of that. My parents are crazy but communicated well and always deeply respected each other.

- someone needs help figuring out exactly what dose of their DOC to take to get high to a very specific extent, or to perform a very specific task

- someone experienced with dope one day finds they don't get as euphoric as they usually do - perhaps they actually feel a bit down. What madness is this?

- someone allegedly very experienced with dope references a specific time that they ingested a large amount of impossibly pure product, and were a hero for still standing up. Said person then ingests some powder that constricts his pupils, forces him to vomit onto his dog, and constipates him. He wonders what this substance is because he does lots of dope.

- someone injects their morning stash and suffers some horrifically terrifying symptom that nobody on the internet is qualified to deal with, casually asking for advice if anyone has any. (Any advice other than 'it's cool bra, shoot up some more and chill' will be ignored.)

I'm happy to hear your bf is doing well! I'm also sorry to hear you're going through some trials of your own. I try to keep in mind regardless if I'm sober or high, there will always be challenges and difficulties. Such is life.

I'm all for subs if they allow a person to gain some normalcy in their life. I'm also about NA, SMART Recovery, methadone, ibogaine, therapy, and alternative treatments; Whatever works best for each individual. I believe standardized treatment is a joke; we are all different people, with different personalities and backgrounds, and in different points in our addiction. Why should there be a standard way of treatment when we, as people, aren't all the same? The fact is that your chances of staying clean are about the same no matter what route you take.

I'm currently on Day 4 of my self-imposed WD. I'm just about through the acute part, now for a week of cold feet and sweaty, broken sleep, ha! Just the price you gotta pay when you dance with the devil. Overall, I'm also kinda a mess right now. I quit my shit corporate job to freelance but since I've been on a deep dope run, I really haven't been working at all and have drained my savings. Money goes quick when you have a habit. I think I'll start looking immediately into another 9-5 as I need routine in my life, or else I seem to fall to pieces.

"How big is your habit (weight and $) ? 

When you had a girlfriend, would you still go on man dates? What if you had one now? You sound like a great guy, just have a bad addiction you are working for. 

What were your dreams? What is holding you back from getting them? You're a straight dude, you can't go on forever like this or it will hurt you deep. Your actions don't define your sexuality; your true wants do. And from reading above, you sound like you love the vagine ;)

Have you tried to get off dope for a while? Is it too unrealistic because you need dope to date? I love money too like a drug itself so I can understand that. When I was younger I would date the older dope dealers who had $ and fatty sacks. I was addicted to meth then. I totally understand why you do what you do. If it paid to be a lesbian I would have done that.

Doesn't matter if u take it only during one part of the day u hear people taking it throughout the day because they enjoy redosing and staying high all throughout the day instead of one giant dose .. Sorry to say but u probably are addicted and will experience withdrawals if u stop. I hope I helped u figure out ur questions and if u need someone to talk to I am here and so are others.

you will enjoy suboxone with no opiate dependence. I agree though start at 1 mg, after 45 mins (not a hour) if you WANT TO, take another mg.

He always has dope, and it's usually good. He has been mostly trustworthy up until now. If he is waiting, he is straight about it and will not have you sitting in a parking lot for hours telling you he's about to pull up, over and over again. 

He will actually call you when he is ready instead of forgetting about you and making you track his ass down. He NEVER makes me wait at a spot like a lot of my ""g"" type, non-addict connects do. 

He is way more on point than any of that type dealer I've ever had(I haven't lived in open air market cities though, must be nice to have that as a back up, in case your dude flakes). 

His only flaw is that, due to his habit, he has dipped bags a few times. That and he isn't mobile. I always have to go to his spot (which i prefer anyway, unless I'm stuck sick at work and need delivery). 

Anyway, I'm rambling , sorry.... I just don't think being an addict absolutely negates one's ability to be a ""real"" dealer.

It really depends on tolerence and only the person using can determine what theirs is. I used to get 50mcgs  and my tolerance was pretty high was taking 4 30mg blues a day for a few years. At first I'd gum half a 50mcg but after doing that a few times I'd just gum the whole thing. I never OD'd or anything. I'd just feel fantastic and nod. Obviously everyones different and you always want to ease into things when trying a new opiate or fent specifically. If you only took vics or 10mg percs few times a day obviously it's going to be dangerous....but for me even after a few times of gumming 50mcgs it stopped getting me high.,cp04nnx,opiates,1425151030,LittleEl,1,0

"Oi, psychiatric evaluative hold isn't a very good detox strategy. Just google or call local hospitals in your area and most provide detox services. A good portion of them indeed do not have the space for separate detox and psych facilities but if you go in to get detained (for I presume telling the clerk you intend to kill yourself) you'll have a far rougher time than you would if you simply go in saying you're a junky and need to quit. If you do suspect that there is some sort of underlying mental illness involved in your addiction no professional can give you an accurate assessment until you've gone through detox anyway, and even with just a small habit cold turkey W/Ds in a psych ward sounds unimaginably horrible. Medical detox varies depending on where you go and your insurance or lack there of but at the least you can expect some clonidine and ativan every few hours or if you're really lucky some subutex. I'd suggest inquiring sooner rather than later and going ahead and inquiring about medical detox and your options now so that if there is a wait for beds you'll be able to schedule in advance your plans after your exams. If you're actually serious about your recovery the people monitoring you during said detox will provide you with all of the resources to find continued outpatient or inpatient care after the fact and probably hand you a silly sheet telling you how bad drug addiction is.

I also have degrees from Oxford University,  University in London and Masters in Economics.  I'm 28. Finished school at 15 (most people do in Ukraine,  at 15 -  18).  I've owned 2 companies and made average of 180k a year.  And I often misspell due to autocorrect,  or due to not knowing one or two words in the 7 languages I speak.  But that for damn sure doesn't make me illiterate or uneducated.  

So just to make this clear to those who use simple mistakes or misspells as a sign of illiteracy -  even those who type like
""boi me need sum 4square biyuatch yueehaaaa "",  could surprise you,  they could have their reasons for typing it.  Some are infact stupid,but then what?  Education doesn't come cheap,  mine sure as hell didn't at 60k a year. 

Anywhoo,  like I said,  I'm not getting in between,  maybe this guy deserved to be spit at,  I can't tell.  But in general,  it's more embarrassing for those who use autocorrect mistakes in others to jump at their throat,  are the once who should be embarrassed,  it's a pity thing to pick for fight.

There's really no chart that says how high you'll get that is useful afik. There's the morphine based opiate comparison charts but that also says bupe is something like 10x morphine so I think it's more to do with affinity and half life than efficacy.

"Well it isn't like you will experience withdrawals instantly. It takes time to build a tolerance and then to have withdrawals. If you don't use opiates often (like only once a month or once every three weeks or so) you would be fine using poppy seed tea a couple days in a row. The addiction part comes with repeated use though, and tolerance and dependance can sneak up you really fast. If you use it say everyday for a week and then don't touch opiates for a couple of months you will be fine. 

The problem is that opiates are pretty hard to control that way. In fact they are damn near impossible to use responsibly once you have a taste for it. My advice would be to keep it to a once a month thing at most. This will help avoid the mental cravings that lead to addiction. Of course if I were you I would just not ever fuck with them ever, but we both know that is not going to happen. Opiates are not like any other drug in regards to becoming addicting. They are sneaky as fuck. No hangovers, they feel amazing, they are literally the cure-all for pretty much everything. But the minute you find yourself making excuses to use more....you are fucked.

"It doesn't have to be like that. Not all addicts ""inflict the misery of death"" on those around them. I've probably been a bit of a handful at times for my friends and family, but I don't steal from them or scam them, I don't neglect my responsibilities TOO much (it does happen, admittedly). 

I want to point out what you say about how it's ""freeing"" because you don't have to feel responsibility for your actions. This is really murky because I do believe someone in the depths of a habit isn't in FULL control, but at the same time I think the number one reason addicts don't feel responsibility for the bullshit we do is that society TELLS us ""it's the evil drugs man, that's not you"", and we tell ourselves that. It's mostly bs, in my opinion. ""The game ain't gotta be played like that"". I've been an addict for way too fucking long and I have done shameful shit to stay well, but I came to a point where I had no one to blame, not even drugs, but myself. 

There's no reason that being an addict means you have to lie cheat and steal. It is possible to maintain a reasonable habit with a reasonable job. It's difficult, and I do think opiates fuck with our brain chemistry to sort of re-order our priorities, but you just have to be aware of that and be prepared for it.

edit: and if you want to get all tin-foil hat about it, that's exactly what ""the man"" wants. They want us drug users to be scumbags so they can show us off the public and say ""THAT's why we need to put little johnny in prison for one joint, so he doesn't turn into one of these junkies who will steal the pipes under your toilet WHILE you're shitting in it for his next fix"". The only way to fight this is to be upstanding citizens. No, I don't think that's going to happen, and I don't think anyone's going to start a ""junk power"" movement successfully, but even so I try my damnedest, and I do find myself slipping at times, to not play into that system.",cokpeip,opiates,1423864659,indalcecio,1,0

but if professional phlebotomist's  and nurses have trouble hitting you and need to go into places like your hand, i think you just got the short end of the junky genetic stick. 


the only thing i could possibly even suggest is LOTS of excercise..and there are excercise supplements like nitric acid that will make your veins bulge huge after a while. i dunno if you are a man or woman, but if you are a male, another side effect is along making your tally-wacker larger, from more regular blood flow. so take that as you will lol.

"Wow thats awesome! Answered all my questions nicely! Just wondering though, so theres a separate test for the HCV antibody and the HCV virus? And the 'levels' they test for is viral load, right? So say your body fought it off, or you did treatment, you'd obviously still test positive for the HCV antibody, but if you did a HCV test it'd be negative? And your viral load would be like 0? So you'd have to request separate tests? Like first you'd get the antibody test, and if positive, then you'd get a HCV test, and if thats positive, then you'd get tested to determine the genotype you have and your viral load, and figure out the best option for treatment? Then after treatment is completed, you'd get retested for HCV (obviously not the antibody since that'll be positive for life), and it'd come back negative if the treatment was successful,  and the viral load test would come back zero? am i understanding this correctly?",cojxzpp,opiates,1423797761,n0dsquad,1,0

As for snorting, more, smaller lines spread over the course of a few minutes (perhaps switching nostrils as well) works better than snorting fewer, fatter lines. Like you heard, it's best not to just snort super hard. Snort just hard enough that it is in your nose and not coming back out again. You want to try and avoid a drip with heroin as any that ends up in your stomach is absorbed much more poorly than the stuff in your nose (as opposed to something like oxy.) I like to snort a few drops of water (dip your finger in a little water and snort it off) after a line as it seems to help it absorb and work better. If I'm snorting something like oxy (which has a better oral BA than intranasal) I like to use a plain saline nasal spray about 20-30+ minutes after I'm done and then swallow the drip from that. It helps get any leftovers into your stomach so that you can absorb anything left over. Doing this for heroin and the like would only be good to clear your nose for the next time, and therefore make more clean surface area for it to stick to and absorb through, you snort.

Sometimes going as far as defending them or justifying their actions. I have been shooting for several years, I hate being dope sick as much as the next guy, I've never put hands on a girl, I rarely if ever yell, I am not mentally or physically abusive in any way. If a girl is or a guy is towards me I end the relationship of friendship. I was forced to live through it and had to watch it happen to my mom for many years. I eventually found ways to take the beatings for my mom and little brother. So I have no respect, no remorse for an abuser. There is nothing in the world that they or anyone can say that will make it ok in the least or even make it a little better. There is no excuse or justification for it. Only a reason and I don't accept that reason to be drugs or alcohol. It is much simpler than that. It is part of their character. I know because I live it. Addiction doesn't determine my actions. Everything I do is a choice I am always in complete control over myself. As humans we chose to do or not do drugs. That's why I don't buy into theAA philosophy we are powerless.

You can stay with people anywheres from a couple days to a year depending on the host.

I think that maybe this could be a positive experience... Life is what you make it, so embrace this new place and start a new life.

"They are bags made of wax paper, and they are used to measure out and sell individual doses of heroin.

When a dipshit cuts his bags with wayyy too much fentanyl, this situation happens and people who think it's just heroin ingest the bag without realizing its far stronger than a typical bag of heroin, and they overdose. Heroin is active at 10+ mg, whereas fentanyl is active in micrograms, and far cheaper than heroin. So when fentanyl and an inactive cut are added to a small bag of heroin, it helps the dealer stretch his profit enormously, at the cost of countless lives when they don't carefully measure the fentanyl.",cozpwex,opiates,1425102043,Aminull,3,0

"I know this is a few months old, but I just got my first prescription yesterday. (20mg of zohydro).  Its to replace my Norco 10mg that I was having to tale 4-6 times a day for the last 8 years (norco/loratab).

I'm not sure how they figure the equivalent of my prescription of Norco strength to what zohydro is.  I asked for zohydro due to I got tired of bring multiple pills to work (those wernt the only ones I had to take, but in a day I have about 8 different medications I have to take).  Clients frown on that.  Also the police don't like that.

If you don't have insurance, its expensive as fuk.  A month supply is $500 USD for 20mg (60caps - for 2 a day)

My insurance co pay brought it down to 70, and they have a coupon you can print out on the main site the can make it as low as $25.  Oddly I didn't have to pay anything for it.

Also note, if you haven't taken it before, pharmacys will only grant you 10mg unless you have taken hydrocodone products in the past.  If you haven't taken hydrocodone in the past, make sure your doctor calls the pharmacy letting them know he/she is prescribing a doseage higher then 10mg.

It was freaking 3 hour hell for me yesterday to get it.  Even though they had it, took three hours to fill, then they told me that crap.  Next month though, it'll be easier as I have been on it already.


Hope this helps!

"Really? Withdrawals aren't real? 

So that's why it's a diagnosed medical condition? That's why doctors prescribe medications to treat it? That's why there's an entire detox industry that revolves around it? That's why there's literally article after article of research discussing and proving its legitimacy?

Your idea that withdrawals are just all made up in the mind of an addict jonesing for a fix is fucking ridiculous to the point of offensiveness. Withdrawal syndromes are a well-known result of multiple substances and medications, not just drugs that get you high. Antidepressants result in withdrawal syndromes but you don't see anyone phoning their dealer for ""just a hit of that good-ass Prozac shit!""

Not to mention the question of how your hypothesis could possibly explain patients using pain medication to treat broken bones or chronic issues, never getting high, never abusing, ready to quit, yet still experiencing withdrawals. Or how about the fact that in studies, those given low doses of opiates over time displayed withdrawal symptoms after being unknowingly taken off and given placebo by researchers?

I get that a lot of withdrawal is definitely mental, that's understandable. However, if you or any of the other supposed hundreds of addicts you know managed to quit with no withdrawal symptoms, you all really need to sacrifice your bodies to science because you manage to literally go against every other piece of research done into the subject.",codgj15,opiates,1423257429,hoodyhoodyhoo,2,0

"Tried over and over to quit.  I couldn't make it long enough, b/c the shit was too close to me - no matter how long I could make it, the cravings were just too strong, and I would relapse.  I realized the only thing that could help was a long time away from it.  I needed to be somewhere where it was extremely difficult to find or obtain.

So I got a job washing dishes in a national park.  My parents were nice enough to buy me a plane ticket (cheaper than rehab!).  I got there early, so I detoxed myself in a hotel room for about a week before my job started.  Just lots of TV, masturbation and immodium.

The great thing about working in a national park is that they give you a free room and 3 hot meals a day, so you can arrive with no money. (Money is actually deducted from your paycheck).

What I got out of it:  4 months away from the city.  I worked 8 hours a day doing physical labor - this was good for my self esteem after working temp jobs/shoplifting for 3 years.  I got a social life - met really interesting people from all over the word, and actually dated a beautiful foreign girl.  It sure beat the isolating life of an addict.

Plus, I used to be an outdoorsy person before my addiction.  So on my time off of work, I could explore 2.2 million acres of wilderness.  This really helped ground me and get me into shape.

By the end of the summer I was in better shape, felt better about myself, and the worst of the craving had died down.

Near the end of the season, they had a job fair &amp; I ended up getting a job at a ski resort.  My life just got better....and more normal after that.

I've been clean for 10 years now.

It's not for everyone.  I had just had it.  I wanted to quit so bad, but it was impossible for me when it was so close and easy to get.  You can probably get drugs anywhere - including national parks. But if you're at the point where you just need a fresh start - hopefully you won't be looking for them when you get there.

Anyway - worked for me.  Good luck.

I don't find the idea attractive, but if it is to that point anyway it would be nice to explore options.  Granted, my experience with psych meds is really limited but honestly opiates were better(and jesus it's not like they were great.)  But with Opiates it seemed liked black and white.

Like a cold or something and the sickness is exacerbating the normal emotional stuff because you stopped (a lot of people feel kind of down for a day or a few after an opiate binge.

I mean, after 1-2 years of messing with them it's possible, but from what I've gathered from other peoples experiences, they usually have to have had a habit previously before they go through WDs after only a few days use, even after a few years of messing with them. I guess the only way to know for sure is to take a break and then see if it happens again the next time you go on a binge (if you so choose to use again, despite knowing that you might be diving deeper into addiction...)

I think your best course of action is to just stop using all together now (or for at least several months or even years) and never find out if you are actually experiencing withdrawal symptoms. If you are indeed going through withdrawals after a 3-4 day binge, you are now balancing on the thin line between recreational use/chipping and full blown addiction.

"UPDATE: Woke up this morning, and the abscess had a white head to it, similar to a zit or whatnot.  So I figure shit's getting real.  I had my girl take me to the Indian Hospital (free to us with even a smidge of injun blood) this evening, and they say that they have to cut it open and drain it.  So they start with the shot of lidocaine, which hurts like a bitch for about 15 seconds until it actually starts numbing the tissue, I actually cussed ""at"" the doctor.   I later apologizedl  Anyway, he cut it and started squeezing the shit out of it, all the while I was clenching my fists and groaning in pain.  I don't know why I didn't watch, I can normally handle shit like that w/ no issue, as well as the pain.  I'm glad I had done a lil shot a couple hours prior otherwise I probably would've came unglued.  He bandages me up and mentions that they'll give me something, and then proceeds to ask me if I'm an IV drug user, so at this point, I lie, and say ""no"" with no hesitation.  So they prescribe 5mg percs and an antibiotic, thank God that I am part Native American, because that allowed me to get all this done at an Indian Hospital and get my prescriptions for free.  (Normally the script of antibiotics they gave me is over $100)

Just wanted to give everyone an update.  My advice to anyone with a similar situation, is that if it keeps getting worse after 2 or 3 days, and comes to a head, definitely get medical attention.  

I also wanted to thank everyone for their advice.

"I tried commenting on this already but for some reason I can not see my post. Please excuse me if you get a response from me twice... I'll try to sum up what I tried saying before.

I think it is possible to use them responsibly. One thing you have to remember is there is a high chance you will build up a tolerance if you will be on them for an extended period of time. A lot of people don't seem to realize this and some drs don't recognize it as well, like they should.

So say that 2 at a time are working for you now. But for example 6 months down the line it isn't helping the pain much anymore so you start taking one more on top of it. This can become a vicious cycle that can spiral out of control very fast. 

However, I think you can be ok as long as you are honest with your self and up front with your dr if they begin to not work as well for you anymore. You seem to be strict with yourself which is good. So if you stick to your game plan, I'm sure you will be fine. 

 I'm not sure if my response is what you are looking for but I also take prescription opiates for chronic pain. I'm just trying to speak from personal experience.

"The ones ive had, i do not remember anything at all except waking up on my face once with needle and dope spilt on the ground. I do have a story about my friend that overdosed in my car though. This is all true tho the part about his mom is hard to believe, it is.
So me and my friend wanted to dope for our last time, lets call him john. John promised his mother it would be his last time doing dope and was broke, so he begged his mom up and down for money and if she gave it to him, he would go to rehab the next week. Johns mom called me and talked to me, asking for me to give him the ride to baltimore as she knew we were best friends and were both dopeheads. I didnt give a fuck, she gave him 60 bucks for me and him to go score..why the fuck not lol i didnt have to quit, he did. So. We go down, get our half, fix up and do our one shot each before the ride home. John always...ALWAYS gets fucked the hell up, nodding out drooling fucked up. So hes passed out the whole ride bac to my town. I had to go to the MVA (MDs place where you get your license and shit) to get my registration renewed. This place takes usually at least 2 hours to get whatever you need done, which is honestly why i questioned gods existence for the first time ever this day. Before i went in to the mva, tristan woke up. I told him he was WAY To fucked up and to NOT do anymore dope while i was inside. He did. I finshed my renewal in literally 30 minutes walked back yo the car, and hes out. Completely limp, blue in the face, drooling, making the nastiest choking breathing sounds ive ever heard. I was completely pissed and scared out my ass. I poured a coke over his head, slapped him.. nothing. I knew what i had to do. I panicly told him ""if you can hear me man im taking you to the hospital...im sorry i know this isnt what you wanted"" or something like that and went to the hospital. When i arrived, i took his dope and needles out his pockets and helped carry him onto the stretcher when he was rushed in. The cops had to be called since it was an OD. Granted, i took a charge as my car was searched, because i threw away the needles and the asshole hospital attendent went into the trash and picked them out for the cops to see. Wouldnt let me leave, but i saved my best friends life. 
To this day, as i said it made me question gods existence because what was the chance that his mom who would never support our habits, gave him 60 dollars for his ""last"" time, the mva only took 30 minutes which it NEVER has the 15 times ive been there its always been at LEAST 1 hour and a half, and that he wouldve been declared dead if he got to the hospital 3 minutes later than we got there.
Sad to say, my bestfriend moved and did go to rehab after this. I caught a charge, but still got to do my dope when i got home, which knocked me the fuck out btw.

"LOL great minds think alike. I was thinking when that fuckface said '...these guys got my back', just throwing it in reverse, then rev the engine, and speed right into those assholes, pinning them against the wall. and back up and ram into them again. because guaranteed if they got skeet's back, they're also worthless subhuman scum. But yeah irdc how 'evil' this sounds, but skeet doesn't even deserve to die with a simple gunshot wound, or giving him str8 acetyfentanyl and saying its powder dope so he OD's... he deserves to atleast feel how he made his victims feel, times 100. Like keeping him locked somewhere and tortured in the way that he fucked with his victims... taunting him with dope and food and water and shit, and letting him die a slow death from starvation or w/e. 

Now keep in mind, I don't think I personally could be capable of any of that shit lol. Maybe shooting someone in the foot or something... but I dont think i could purposely kill someone. Doesn't mean I can't hope they fuck with a psychopath who will torture him for 2 weeks in his basement until that dumbfuck skeet dies slowly and painfully lol. And the only things that make me even think of that or wish it on someone is when someone or a group of people (like gangs, or legal gangs, e.g. the police) commit such unjust acts and act pompous and not even slightly remorseful about it... there's already way too many people in this world, assholes like them need to be at the very least killed w/o torture. 

Like I said, irdc about what some random internet strangers think of me, if they think im nuts or something. Because I know even when people get ripped off or something, and act like they don't care, I'm sure they really do. But when you get walked on your whole life and taken advantage of when you're the nicest person, it really gets to you after a while and you really want revenge.

"So I guess it mainly comes down to being unaware of how to make it/get right seeds and simply inconsistency. 

Fair enough, my first try PST worked great for me.  I bought them in the bulk section of an oriental supermarket.  I've only done PST 4 times but each time its worked and been consistent, seeds from the same oriental supermarket.

I guess what really boggles my mind is that its SO much cheaper than buying pills, which is why I didn't understand why more opiate users and/or addicts didn't spring for it, but now I know.

Anyways in regards to making it, its actually super simple, I'll run you guys down my process.

You need:

-2L softdrink bottle
-Another wider mouthed bottle (can be much smaller), gatorade or vitaminwater bottle works good
-Clean sock or t shirt
-Cold water
-Lemon juice or a lemon
-Funnel (not really necessary)

-Take the 2L bottle and with the funnel put in the 1.5LBs of seeds.

-Fill the bottle with water, or if you want lemonade or iced tea to the point where the liquid is above the seeds by about 1cm or so

-Squirt in some lemon juice, I normally use all the juice from one full lemon, or all the liquid from those tiny plastic lemon juice containers

-Close the 2L and shake that bitch for 10 minutes.  Thats my time limit, I don't know if its the best but by 10 minutes of hard shaking I'm done lol.

-Unscrew the 2L and use either a clean sock or t shirt or whatever as a filter and simply filter the liquid (via squeezing etc) into the wide mouthed bottle.  

-You're done. Drink slowly obviously.

I find the taste isn't even bad at all, just a slight poppy seed taste to it with lemon.  If you substitute water for iced tea or lemonade which I've done once, you can barely taste the poppyseeds at all.

YMMV

"Oh your not australian? Coz I spent like 5 years at university just putting it on hex and never paying a dollar and never completing a degree from like 20 to 26. I kept dropping out and changing courses but never had any problems.

At 28 I went to a private uni on fee-help, just signed a form and never paid a dollar either.

Im sure I probably have some major debt for when I earn over $60k to pay off but at least im happy in my career.

So yeah if you are australian like I suspect then you definitely havent blown your chances, just go to a private uni with fee-help like I did once you use up all your Hex. PM me if you want and ill reccomend you good private universites that you'd be elligible for. Good thing about the one I went to was I completed a 3 year degree in 2 years too.

Also once you've been on 'Aus-Study' for the max amount of time you can just go on 'work for the dole' and still study full time, they honestly dont mind. I did that the whole of last year without ever lookign for a job.

You're supposed to release the tourniquet before you push down on the plunger. Basically its just to pop the veins making it easier to find a vein. Its bad to inject while the tourniquet is still on.

The bottom heats up to melting, but the top stays solid and traps everything inside. Learning when to remove/re-add heat is the big trick.

"I just got my first script of tram in about 6 months and I've taken them quite a bit in between binges of heavier opiates (including dope). For the past month or so I've been doing about a half g of dope/day. But after 36 hours on subs, I started the trams yesterday. 

I took 3 (150mg) when I woke up this morning and I have no WD symptoms at all and even feel ""good."" Im definitely not high like off an opiate. But it's been about three hours since I took it, maybe 3-4 hrs actually. But I can def feel the mental/SNRI effects from it and it is *really,* genuinely helping with my ankle pain. Some days I'll do 200mg oxy and my ankle will still be on fucking fire. 

I'd say maybe start with 100-150mg and after an hour/hour and a half you aren't feeling it too much, take another 100 or so. I dunno just go slow- AFAIK it's not sustained release, it is just very long-lasting compared to hydro or oxy so it feels like ER maybe. I dunno, the peak for me is usually the 3-4 hour mark, where I am rn. Im taking lunch break at work. Haf. Listening to ""mr Crowley"" on repeat hahahah.

I will tell you this story, and take from it what you want. My brother was 26 years old when he really hurt his back working for UPS, and doing construction with our dad. He started like you, with a legit script for his pain for his jacked up back. Then he started abusing them. He dabbled with some other drugs, but he wasn't going to start using heroin. Well... a few months later and he starts using heroin. But he's only going to smoke it. He's NEVER going to shoot it. But then he finds out you can buy clean needles, CHEAP at the PHARMACY! So how bad can it be? But he's only going to do it once in a while. He's going to be a chipper. He's not going to be an addict, he's just going to chip. That lasted about a year. And then my brother started to change. I am not sure how often he was shooting up, but he was definitely addicted. He came to us and begged for help to get clean. He was miserable and desperate. He started on Suboxon, and was constantly feeling awful about himself. It was the worst thing to witness.. then he seemed like maybe he was coming out of it. He got a new job, he just seemed happier. Then on January 2nd of this year, he said he was going to play disc golf with some friends, and we never saw him again. He died alone, in his car, after OD'ing on heroin. I promise you, he NEVER ever thought in a million years this was going to be him, just like you right now are thinking, it will never be you. The truth is, heroin will take away everything from you. So please, run away and don't look back.

According to the conspiracy theory, to answer the question ""why did he still have tar left"" .. SUPPOSEDLY -- on some conspiracy theorist website I read on years ago, is that the toxicology showed that he had a lethal dose of heroin in his system.   

So the theory goes that somebody gave him a ""hot shot"" (lethal dose of H) and when he passed out/dead from the h, shot him in the face, and staged it at suicide.  This was years ago, but I remember evidence was along the lines of the toxicology report, and also something to do with the amount of blood wasn't enough, that it indicated he was already dead when he was shot with the shotgun.

"Dude, no worries. I'll echo other people's suggestions and say to get a bottle of fake piss at a tobacco or head shop, hopefully they come with hand warmers but if they don't, get some of those too. About an hour before you have to test, secure a hand warmer to the bottle with a rubber band and let it heat up to a sufficient temperature on the temperature gauge on the bottle. If you're a guy, attach the bottle to the inside of your boxers with some duct tape. Usually these kinds of tests for jobs are not closely monitored like they would be for, let's say, probation or court or something like that. You may even be alone in the room. So it may be incredibly easy to get away with using the fake piss, you just have to see what happens when you get there. If there is someone in the room with you, just fasten the bottle with duct tape near the fly of the boxers so that you can simulate whipping out your shit and just squeeze the bottle that way.

And also, it's true what others have said...they aren't going to drug test you at the interview itself. I know one time, I went to an interview and they wanted to hire me, so they told me to go to a certain spot and drug test right after the interview, but that's only happened to me one time.

"I've used it casually, mostly before my diagnosis and slightly afterwards. The 'lull' caused by the opiates is a temporary relief from any sort of instability. If anything, it makes me calm, collected, and much more 'baseline normal."" It certainly takes the edge off, and I'm more okay with the fact that I may not be entirely okay. 

However, without consistent use, they can make me dip into a depressive state. It's nothing severe, but the world seems more lackluster and I'm much more aware of pain and emotional hurt, or the sense of things being not quite right. Granted, my use is typically larger, spaced out doses. I'm curious if a lower, daily / weekly supplement would be beneficial.

"Wow. First off that is absolutely terrible about what happened when your first pup when he was still actually a pup. Kids can be extremely cruel and down right evil. Most all of them bark loud and often but the smell is variable IME.  The male I had growing up (Jack) smelled really bad no matter what. Even right after a bath just like yours. The two females I have had though never smelled. I'm not sure if gender has anything to do with it at all. Probably not. We pretty much gave up on bathing the male because no matter what he was still smelly old Jack and his cost always seemed fine. It really wasn't an issue though because my pups live outside. They have access to a doggie living area in the heated garage. It's pretty much an area under the large wall shelving unit outfitted with straw and toys etc. 

Still man I'm sorry about your first pal. I know he survived but still. Kids probably grew up to be serial killers or something.

"Hey, that's so funny, the link you provided is the exact same place I went to for treatment! LOL

I see that the staff has changed.  That guy Rocky was a real douche.  He was hardly there and when he was, he was just a total dick to me for no reason.  I never understood why and I stayed away from him the whole time I was there.  I later kinda learned something bad about him that I wasn't supposed to find out about but did.  I obviously won't post that here, but you can PM me if you wanna know more details.  Long story short, I don't think he's a good person. The other staff members were really cool to me, especially Claire, she was really genuine, sweet, and caring; but I don't see her listed on the website anymore.  That's too bad, as I thought she was the only person that made it worthwhile.  

About my journey, well, my memory's fuzzy about all the details, since it's been years now.  But as I mentioned, I went for meth addiction.  

They required me to go see a cardiologist in the states to have my heart checked out.  After I arrived, I was taken to a local doctor there that did a few simple tests again to make sure my heart was OK.  Then, I was kept in detox mode for a week.  They gave me small amounts of (bad) marijuana and xanax to keep me relaxed and to help me sleep, which I was truly grateful for.  They started me off on ""root bark smoothies,"" which were smoothies made with the root of the iboga plant.  They said it would get my body used to having it in my system or something like that.  I noticed that it did give me some energy and made me feel better somewhat.  

Then came time for administration of the ibogaine.  It came in the form of a white powder inside gel-caps.  I remember they made the whole experience seem somewhat ""religious"" which I didn't like, because I'm not a very spiritual or religious person.  They made me dress in all white, there were candles and incense lit, and the guy giving it to me was saying all this spiritual hippie nonsense.  They gave me the pill, and let me lie down in bed to wait for it to kick in.  They placed some water and juice next to me, along with a trash can just in case I vomited.   

I don't really recall the details of the drug's onset, but once I started tripping, I remember being really thirsty and killed like 3 bottles of the water and juice. You're supposed to stay lying down because once you start really tripping, ataxia kicks in and it is HARD for you to walk straight and keep your balance. So I was lying down and I entered into a half-sleep/half-awake trance like state, where I felt like I was dreaming.  I didn't have a mind-blowing experience like I've read from others' reports.  But once the trip got going, it was kicking my ass! It felt so intense and overwhelming. They were also playing this AWFUL tribal drumbeat music that I found completely annoying. I mean, they had that playing on loop for HOURS! I started seeing images of a jungle (probably because of the tribal music) and I saw a lot of insects, especially ants, for some unknown reason.  WEIRD.  I then had thoughts about my deceased grandparents and my childhood experiences like my grandfather teaching me to ride my bike, my first crush in elementary school, etc.  The crazy thing about this drug is that it does indeed make you think about your ancestors (in my case my grandparents) and the past.  It made me think about my life and how I should change for the better. I was stuck in that state for what must have been about 2-3 hours.  Then I felt like I could move about a bit.  I went outside onto the balcony for a smoke and met the other guy who was doing the treatment with me.  We smoked some weed, had some cigs and talked about our experience.  He was doing it for his heroin addiction and he told me that he immediately felt no withdrawal symptoms and that he didn't feel sick like he should be feeling.  We then went back to our beds and the guy who gave us the pills came in and asked, ""are you ready to take it to the next level?"" while offering another pill.  I thought, ""fuck it,"" and took it.  The trip continued with the same imagery and thoughts about my childhood and life.  By the time I was able to move about again, it was nighttime and I went outside and noticed that my vision was affected.  Everytime my eyes moved and looked at lights they would leave trails.  These trails would last for a few days after.  

All in all, I think the drug itself was a good experience for me.  I liked that it made me think about my life and what I was doing to my body, I liked that it made me want to better myself, and how it made me feel peaceful.  I remember thinking that the world could really use a drug like this.  HOWEVER, I really didn't enjoy my experience at that particular treatment facility. How Rocky treated me was a big factor, and I thought they overcharged like crazy.  It cost me $7,000.  And you know what? Speaking from personal experience, it was NOT effective as a treatment for METH addiction.  After about 4 months, I relapsed hard and became even more addicted to meth than I'd ever been.  While I was there, they tried to explain to me about how Ibogaine worked ""scientifically."" They told me that it ""changes your brain,"" so that even if you do meth after doing Ibogaine, you won't get high.  Bullshit. This was not true at all.  Eventually I was able to quit after battling meth addiction for another 2 years, but only by my own resolve and with the help of family.  I've been clean for almost 3 years now and I'm really glad I am.  ",coqyqh1,opiates,1424393238,KnowledgeMC,1,0

Its not up until August if I continue this way...which I will haha.
TL;DR 
IF you can actually pay it back like the following pay period its a life saver. If not youll end up paying thousands in interest, as I am. Also, no they do not go by credit but your bank cant be negative and you need to be employed for 6 months. No stubs needed, its all done electronically.

"Okay buddy. Just so you know the ""dragon"" is only used as euphemism for smoking opiates, mainly heroin but can be used for smoking pills. Lol. So your habit is only oral so you don't even fuck with the dragon, you aren't slaying him or whatever. No big deal but I laughed reading some of your comments. Also 600mg oral of what? You didn't say what you are taking. I know people that were doing upwards of 3 grams of heroin a day, at my most I was doing about 4 grams a day. Which is much more than 600mg of everything except dilaudid and opana. So morphine and lesser. It was dumb. I'm so glad I don't do nearly that much. I don't even use daily. Anyone can do it but its easier for some than it is for others especially when pain is an issue like it is for me. Its really rough sometimes.Sorry if I sounded rude I wasn't making fun of you. Nothing wrong with not being in the drug culture or being up on the lingo. I just wanted to clear it up for you. The reason the term dragon started is due to the smoke from heroin, then it started being used for smoking pills because doing heroin is the same as taking pills. They are both narcotic opiates that give really similar highs. They both can be used recreationally abused and also used responsibly and safely. So don't buy into any of that bs about pills being better than heroin mumbo jumbo. Its basically propaganda that only the uneducated on the subject put any value on. Good luck and happy nods!Oh yeah give us an actual breakdown of what you take and how much daily. You can't say you swallow 600mg and have us know what that means.

"I was def one of those people who said wait 24hrs to start subs without making the point that it could be less for others.

... The absolute **best advice** I can give if you know you need to transfer from opiates to subs soon, is to dose with your DOC in the mid/late afternoon (unlike right b4 bed like I always used to, crashing when I was super high). If you make your last dose in the fternoon you will basically be coming down by the time you are ready for bed, but most importantly not too sick to sleep, maybe the yawns at worse. This way your almost at the 24 hour mark (if you can sleep til noonish) with minimizing the amount of hours suffered).

"I wouldn't recommend Vietnam. I would recommend Thailand. Preferably Southern Thailand. Saigon is HCMC, and yes, you can score fairly easily there I only tried to once.

Fent is tough though, I feel you. I only binged it for about a week, but god*damn* did my tolerance spike during that week.

Not from lope but I've had full on hospital level pwd on multiple occasions that also last around 48 hrs before getting the 'relief' of just normal severe acute wd. So I'm hesitant to say one way or another considering the extreme an in fact unbelievable hell it is. My multiple experiences have worked out fine but I have always also waited a decent amount of time before inducting considering how much pwd has become an issue over the last 6ish years of sub maintenance. That being said on other opiate forums there are multiple accounts of people who have had some serious problems inducting. Iirc this primary happened to those who had been maintaining on lope for an extended time. That would make sense to me but I'm not positive those were the only instances. It took me a long time to piece all of my info on lope-sub when I was concerned about it so I wanted to put some info out for others who also get pwd even after waiting ~40hrs and are similarly concerned.,coe0khk,opiates,1423312453,ProllyChris,1,0

- 'what's up with this yo, last night I smoked a .2 of the same dope I smoke every night...and instead of feeling happy and detached I felt...kinda bummed out?! What's wrong with me, help!'

- 'I'm a hardcore dopefiend, I once snorted a line of 99.9% pure diacetylmorphine that my chemist cousin made in his lab, and this line was literally three kilometres long - I know this cause snorting it took us from his basement to the 7/11 which is pretty much exactly almost kinda three kilometres!! And this line didn't even touch me yo, my cousin was stumbling around vomiting and couldn't spell his own name backwards or put his sweater on forwards. But last week I smoked a point of the stuff my pal at work gets every day, and it made me trip out something weird - my pupils went all small, I was spinning out, all itchy and shit, projectile vomiting all over my pet dog...and get this afterwards I didn't shit for like 4 days! What was this shit cause it wasn't dope!'

- 'so I banged up my usual morning shot and my fingernails immediately all fell out. I started growing furry sets of breasts and according to my roommate I'm speaking in tongues. I don't really wanna go to the emergency room so do y'all think this will go away if I leave it?'

- 'hey, I'm just like you guys - in that I am a complex human being, with my own story; each day of mine is, like yours, packed with experience and wonder, whether good or bad, painful or strengthening. I'm developing my own way of understanding the world, and my body is a product of the specific diet I consume, the unique exercise regimen I put it through, and the substances I inflict on it.

Down here, we get points and g's. Never (like 100% never) have I heard anyone offering or asking for a stamp/bag/bun/bundle/finger/whatever. Never even heard of those terms until last year when I started lurking this sub

I've tried to keep it straight on my own cuzzzzzzzzz if someone asked me ""how much heroin is in a half gram?"" I would look at them with one of my more bitchy faces lmao

But, as far as I've been able to decipher- a bag is meant to be a point, or 1/10 of a gram. A bundle is 10 bags/stamps right? So buying a bundle is basically buying a gram, although on here I've read quite a bit about how stamp bags are usually more like 0.07ish instead of a straight 0.1? Also, how much is in a finger? Literally just too dumb (or too high) to have figured that out yet lol. Also just got high for the first time since a week ago. Yay for everything! Sorry for the dumb question tho.

"Well that's at least one thing you can throw in the W column. It's not pathetic man- Tao many people have more fucked up/ pathetic ways to feel happy. At the moment, you're going through some tough shit without your parents and your girlfriend. Some REAL tough shit. Firstly, if that baby isn't yours, send that bitch PACKING.  I know it will be hard- you love her. But it is the only option that doesn't end in miseeg for you. A leopard doesn't change its spots; if she cheated once, she *will* do it again. 

Now as far as your yup parents are concerned,I know it is hard for you to see, but they only do what they do because they love you. I know that sounds very cliché but it's the truth man. I know that because my parents both yuppies as well. When I I was in high school I did not get along with my parents at all- we fought at every turn. They were just fucking all over me.  Today, my mother and father, apart from my three brothers and my sister, are my two best friends in the world.  That is the gods honest truth.  I know that an opiate addiction definitely makes your situation very unique. But I would suggest the following:

Let them help you. This is what they want. They want to help you best your addiction first and foremost. And they want to help you reach your potential as a human being.  This is starting to sound a little like a bullshit something... But dude - let them in. You may not have a ton in common given their yuppie status- but find some ground, and just try and nurture the relationship.  Like I said before- these are two of the most important relationships you will ever have.  You are still very very young and, I would imagine, your relationship is still DEFINITELY salvageable- do it.

So - lose the chick, find someone who loves you and isnt going to fuck around behind your back.  That is a very fundamental rule- no cheating.... Second, put some effort into your relationship with your parents.  Let them help you get clean - if that is what you want. It will do wonders for your relationship. I hate to see a relationship with parents suffering- they are the most special people in your life - I hope you realize that sooner rather than later. Best of luck my mab.

Its terrible of him to subject the poor little kiddo to that. Its impossible to protect your kids everything negative in this world and honestly you wouldn't want to. They need to have a realistic foundation of what this world is truly like. That is one thing I commend you for trying to protect your kids from. After having time to think about it I projected my issues onto you. Which wasn't right. I guess I just wanted to show that your situation isn't nearly as bad as it can be while also showing what could happen if you don't stay strong and vigilant.Edit: I worry too much and I care too much sometimes. I care about you even though I don't know you. Just like I care about everyone I interact with and even those I don't. I honestly want the best for everyone.

"Had a friend who I would middle weed too. I never made any money from it, I just asked for $5 for gas and I'd bring him what he wanted. 

So one day I'm bringing him like an 1/8th and he just says ""Thanks man, you've been a great friend to me"" and he asks if I wanted this pill. It was a 30 mg roxy, and I knew how much one was worth, but had never gotten into to opiates anything past kratom. 

Something about getting a free $30 pill just seemed so awesome to me, so of course I took it and I had no idea what to do with it. I messaged him a bit, asking about the usual shit. Saying well isn't it addictive? and he was just like ""ehh, idk. i just like taking it with dxm. it goes great with it. and it goes good with weed."" and the way he made it seem on top of him just GIVING me one got rid of that fear.

 so I did some research and decided sniffing was the way to go. I sniffed the entire thing and didn't get shit out of it except for some kind of head buzz. Next I traded him some mxe for one i think, and he would talk about how eating it was the way to go. So I said fuck it and took some baby woodrose seeds and ate half of it and had the most amazing trip. 

i would trade weed for blues every once in a while. im talking like $10-$15 worth of weed for one so of course i did it as much as i could. 

THEN I'm picking up herb from my dudes house and him and i arent friends. it was all business and great prices. nothing better than a dealer who gets right to it. but anyways im picking up and he said ""i got blues too. $20"" and again i couldnt say no to these prices. So i scoop one up and he then tells me ""i got 15s too. I'll sell em for $8 so you can flip em"" and thats when i got hooked.

Then I got an rx for them and I was able to take one or 2 a day at most and taking a good break inbetween days 3-5 days easy. Then after that I started taking them daily, then overtaking them. I then gave up my script. I could have kept going and getting them, I just decided not too, but I moved on to kratom. Then my tolerance skyrocketed. 1-2 pills at a time turned into 6 at a time turned into CWE. Then I got a hold of fentanyl patches and had a steady supply and have just over done it from there.

I am absolutely not blaming you, but if you can be nonjudgmental when he tells you he is using, planning to use, in withdrawal, WHATEVER, it's a lot more likely he will be honest with you. Honestly, the shame he feels from your reactions or anticipating your reactions (again, not blaming you) probably even drive him to use more. That's just how it is. 

You also didn't really explain in what ways the drug use interferes with your relationship, other than being unhappy when he lies to you. Is he just always broke and you end up buying his shit? Or something else?",co7ex2p,opiates,1422763774,wildthrift,2,0

"You could plug it, but of course that's a hell of a lot less convenient that doing a line. It's healthier too, though. You save your sinuses quite a bit of stress if you stop putting shit up there. 

It sounds like at this point though, if you're using 150mg of fire dope on a responsible day, that you're probably just addicted, and the whole social butterfly thing is probably not quite as relevant anymore. It's easy to convince yourself that you're addicted to a secondary byproduct of a drug (social, sexual, personal type stuff) when that is what initially pushed you towards using, when really that factor is in the past and you're actually just addicted. I did this with many different drugs for many different reasons. 

Now that being said, if you're still convinced that heroin is helping you socially, I advise you to think about whether that statement is still true; and be very honest with yourself. And also to realize that the deeper you go, the more hedonistic this addiction will become, which inevitably leads to anti-social behavior. 

I don't want to rant, but I think you should be very honest with yourself about why you currently use. And to answer your question again, put it in your ass. It works better that way. Or you could smoke it, but smoking #4 is a bitch and ime it's not quite as effective as it should be.

If you have reservations about shooting, then good. If you're alright without,  then don't start. And also, if you're getting really really clean dope, like DNM dope, you're doing just about as good for high/price ratio as you can, so your best bet in terms of money would be to share less.

"I wouldn't take it too personally. I mean I used to work as a server and pretty much all the servers under 35 were into opiates to some degree. A lot of times they'd use on the job, too. One of my coworkers decided he was going to try to quit. So the other coworkers stopped talking about opiates with him as a sign of respect; I mean talking about opiates in front of someone only makes it harder for them to quit. But every time he would notice the telltale signs of one of the coworkers' being high (the slightly more relaxed walk, the pinned pupils, the slight rasp to their voices, the slight ""resting face smile"", etc.), you could tell it would just sort of throw him a little off.

I can only imagine how he would have felt if one of the customers he was serving was in full nod-mode. It would have drove him mad.

There are plenty of patients/(ab)users who really prefer hydro over oxy but since all formulations had APAP were forced to use something else that was ineffective/gave the bad side effects/etc. Plus, since doctors tend to be familiar with hydro and consider it relatively weak, it might make them more likely to add some of these onto an existing IR script for all day relief than something much stronger like opana or fent patches or what have you.

That said, cat is out the bag. Your baby is going to be born addicted so you really need to tell your husband now, because he is going to find out sooner than later. The sooner you tell him, the more options you have, and the less of a secret you've kept. There are a whole list of reasons to tell him now, and not down the road. 

Tapering a new born baby isn't an easy process, and you might find that doctors don't know the process for poppy pod tea as well as they might for a more quantifiable type of opiate. You'll also need to tell your doctor at some point before the delivery, so they are ready to do whatever needs to be done to keep your child healthy. Same goes as for your husband, the sooner the better so you have more options. The longer you wait the more upset both your husband and your doctor are going to be.

Also hitting him with the door isn't an easy thing to do unless there is some kind of an altercation, he'd have to be in perfect position for that to happen. It certainly doesn't even come close to justifying a punch to the head/face. I don't mean to push you.  It is a very sore subject for me. I grew up witnessing a lot of domestic violence. Saw my mom getting hit and some times doing the hitting. Of course she couldn't hurt the man but he sure could hurt her.

"Why is it ""sad"" that he didn't know that Percocet went up to 10mg?  Unless you are someone that is regularly prescribed Percocet or it's generic equivalent (oxycodone/acetaminophen), why would you know the different quantities?  Hell, I took Percocet for over 2 years and I had absolutely no idea that they made a 2.5mg quantity.  

And by the way, you're wrong.  They do not make 30mg and 80mgs extended release, especially considering that the original conversation was referring to Percocet.  Percocet refers to the drug combination of Oxycodone/Acetaminophen.  And the Oxycodone quantities in Percocet are 2.5mg, 5mg, 7.5mg, and 10mg.  The other quantities to which you are referring to (30mg and 80mg er) are not Percocet.  The 30mg can be either Oxycodone 30mg Immediate Release or OxyContin (Oxycodone 30mg Extended Release) 30mg.  However, the 80mg quantity could only be an extended release formula (I.e. OxyContin or it's generic equivalent) of Oxycodone.  Either way, neither of them are Percocet.

I know that some here are going to say ""whatever, I call all Oxycodone 'Percocet"".  And that's fine that you call it that but it's wrong.  It's two different products.  There is Percocet 10/325mg and there is Oxycodone 10mg IR.  And these two products (Percocet and Oxycodone IR) share similar Oxycodone quantities.  

Anyway, my biggest reason for posting this is that I couldn't get over the irony of you finding it sad that someone didn't know about higher Percocet quantities yet you were actually wrong (or at least very unclear and vague at best) when continuing to list other quantities.

I don't know, I just found it interesting that you're laughing at someone being a ""noob"", yet I don't know that any real veteran of opiate addiction would consider all of those years of experience am actual accolade to be period of.",co7c6kq,opiates,1422758189,SpecialSause,3,0

my biggest scare happened twice, my girlfriend faded out after a big shot. first time we were at home, took me half an hour to wake her up. she didn't lose color though.

second time was worse, we were out in public, shot up in a slightly hidden spot, she instantly fades out barely breathing. i shook her a bit and stood her up. couldn't stay where we were. after basically dragging her a few blocks she came around but goddamn it scared me.

"I started off at 24mg (3 - 8mg strips per day) spaced out through the day like every 8 hours or so. Then my doctor would cut it down by half a strip every eight days, (until then end when I was down to ¼ of a strip) I would cut the strips up when I was on the smaller doses so I could spread it out through out the day (either every 6, 8 or 12 hours depending on which way was the easiest to break it up) otherwise I would start to feel sick (except for the ¼ that I only took once a day bc thats so small its impossible to break up into smaller pieces) so it went:

- Day 1 through 8 --&gt; 3 strips (24mg)

- Day 9 through 16 --&gt; 2.5 strips (20mg)

- Day 17 through 24 --&gt; 2 strips (16mg)

- Day 25 through 32 --&gt; 1.5 strips (12mg) 

- Day 33 through 40 --&gt; 1 strip (8mg)

- Day 41 through 48 --&gt; ½ strip (4mg)

- Day 49 through 56 --&gt; ¼ strip (2mg)

In all honesty 24mg is really way too much Suboxone no one needs that much. I did that detox and then relapsed and my new suboxone doctor started me off at 8mg, we realized that wasn't enough so he increased it to 12mg and that keeps me feeling good all day. After I relapsed I was using WAY more than the first time when I did the detox. Before the detox I was mostly using blues and just a little heroin. After my relapse I was doing a fuck ton of heroin with a few blues here and there when I couldn't get h or the bags in the buns were so small and expensive that it was more cost effective to buy blues (imagine that -- lol). The current program I am in is a sub maintenance not a detox I started it in November and I am still on the same amount as of now.

"Very good you have the valium and addies, and the lope will help, but if I were I'd STRONGLY consider tapering down over a two week period. Your level in usage is sufficient enough to make going cold turkey a really, really hellish experience. I've been in your shoes(recently as a matter of fact), and here is what I did to make coming down bearable:

- I'm not sure how much will power/self control you have, but I'd start off dosing around 100mg at the beginning of the first week with the goal of tapering to 40mg by the end of the first week by decreasing the dose day by day. 2nd week I'd try to go from 40/30 to about half that by weeks end. 

- I'd dose upon waking up, and going to sleep. 1st dose gets you going, and the 2nd dose is like a little reward for making it through the day that will allow more restful sleep.

- Advil helped me with the aches

- Tylenol for the cold/hot goosebumpy temp issues

- Water and lots of it at every stage, every single day

- Chewable multi vitamin 

- Take your lope in the middle of the day when the WD symptoms come on after you AM dose wears off

- Addies as needed

- Valium in the middle of the day as well, and at night if you're not sleeping well.

This pretty much did the trick for me. Physical exertion seemed to help me work through the WD more smoothly.

"I asked this same question on here awhile back and was told that bulk fentanyl analogue powders are pretty cheap on the dark markets and after doing some research, I found this information true. So they're not cutting it with the super potent fentanyl we are familiar with from patches and lollipops but a fentanyl analogue easily and affordably obtained with TOR and some bitcoin. The analogues are not always as potent as the ""real deal"" but still need to be dosed in micrograms, so they're just as deadly.The following is prefaced with it being common knowledge that fentanyl can and will kill you, so please don't use it recreationally. Fentanyl is not as potent as some people would lead you to believe. A 25mcg/hr patch is roughly equivalent to 45mg oral oxycodone a day. So an entire 25mcg/hr patch is about 150mg of oxycodone. But lets remember that those patches are for 72 hours and the entire patch has just over half a milligram of fentanyl. Using even a tiny amount gives you a lot of bang for your buck. And a lot of blue heroin addicts on your hands. Hopefully all of this information helped answer your question. ",cp09waa,opiates,1425161964,TheOtherWhiteGirl,4,0

"Sorry for the delay in posting the new story and the results!  I have an alright excuse I guess!  

Haha on Sunday I got my work schedule for this week.  On Tuesday I had to work midnight to 8:30AM, which is my very least favorite shift because it messes with my sleep schedule for like a day preceding it and a couple days after as well.  On Wednesdays I always work early morning-ish because that is when the store I work for gets its deliveries. 

Anyways, Sunday evening I go out to buy some black so I can unwind a little bit and let my body relax.  On the way over I remembered that the dude I am going to meet also has clear (meth).  With the busy week and erratic hours that laid ahead, I decided that buying a $20 of some clear with my black would be in my best interest. 

I get to his apartments (which I also lived in once upon a time) and I run into a friend outside the gate,  She was also going to meet him, but her phone had died on the way over and she wanted to call him before knocking.  So she asked me to call and ask if she could walk up with me.  He told me to give her my cash and let her walk up so he didn't have several heads walking in and out of his apartment.  I was fine with that.  Anyways when she came out, she gave me my two bags and I went on my way h0me to go fix up.  When I got there, I realized that the bag of crystals was at least 400% bigger than what I was expecting.  It was literally like 1.5-1.6 grams for $20.  

Originally the clear was just to make sure that I remained awake and productive on those shifts that I wasn't looking forward to.  However, with an abundance like that, I decided to do some as soon as I got home from picking it up (after doing a shot of black of course).   

I got home, immediately went to my room, and cooked up the black I had just bought.  Got a fresh rig ready, took off my jacket, and banged the whole dub in one shot.  While I dd feel the familiar ""fuzzy"" feeling creeping up my neck towards the top of my head, it seemed extra short lived and I didn't feel high for longer than a minute and a half.  So I prepped a decent shot of the clear and banged that next.  That shot was definitely no disappointment.  I got ""the cough"" from it. Any of you who have IV'd speed know what I am talking about.

Anyways, I am going to go smoke a stog, typing all this is taking forever.  I will finish up after I come back inside :)",cocxh0d,opiates,1423213489,ejexe,1,0

I do try to get whatever qualifications I can. And I have 1 hard block I think from I think CrowdSurf.

I usually do anything that I can, a lot of Venue Quality, Coupon Vision, Visual Genome type hits. I regret having done so many for Classify AdImages, they seem to reject some always - No matter how correct your hits are, they always reject like 15% of them. Actually most of my rejections are from them but I keep doing them because they're easy and pay almost immediately. 

And Google's hits are usually awesome. They pay pretty well and seem to always approve your hit, even ones you've clearly fucked up on or left blank. 

People think Mturk is bullshit because they see hits paying out like 5 cents a piece, but when you do like a few hundred of those an hour it's really not bad at all. 

It's really the best and most legitimate way to make extra cash online. For a while I was making a couple hundred a month but I've been slacking.

"I started using because i was prescribed for some injuries. I had an enormous bankroll at the time. I actually thought it helped my performance in what i do and what i enjoyed. It's been about 6 years. I have nothing left, driven myself into debt, and repeatedly made the worst decisions of my life while being under the influence. The other day i took every remaining pill i had knowing that either i wouldn't wake up, or that i wouldn't have money to buy more because i am so far into debt. One ""Use"" will lead to another and your tolerance will skyrocket. I am small, 125 pound male. I used to take 1 10mg hydro pill and be flying. Could never understand how people took so many. Today i could take 3 30mg oxy and just kinda shake it off. Thats a very expensive fucking habit. I have not used in a few days, let me tell you..day one..pitch black vomit, coupled with excruciating side pain. Day 2. Vomit. Day 3 shits so bad i thought i was going to pass out. Everytime i eat i shit. I do not sleep. I feel utterly hopeless. My use was on and off for over a decade...in the last 3 years i can't think of a time where i didn't have a supply to take. I would get enough to last 30 days, and quickly be looking for more in ten. Not only that but FDA crackdown has caused prices to raise a huge amount. When you lose connects and experience that panic, straight misery. Dude if i can tell you anything, it would be to not do it. I just found out i have 4 herniated disks, I can't be prescribed pain medicine due to the damage i have done to my kidneys and liver. I am in my fucking 20's. I will pay for my usage and probably die before i reach 50 because of these choices. If you care to talk more about it let me know, but when your bank account runs out so will your will to live. It's just something you will then have to add to the long list of every day struggles you already face. 


Edit: Let me say that if i had made between 5-10 different choices that were major factors in my collapse, i would be sitting on enough money to retire, and be telling you fuck yeah go for it. However i would still be dying young, I would still feel like shit, and i would still be scraping to find connects to get this shit because doctors are terrified to prescribe it for fear of getting fired. Now i mentioned 5-10 choices spread out over many years...I can say that the whole feeling of invincibility and fuck all must have contributed to the choices not being made correctly because i never felt anything at the time. Now... i feel only regret as well as loss of many things and people i cared about.

"&gt;It was a ridiculous cycle of chasing a feeling that may not have ever existed- the feeling of being satisfied. I am not sure I have that feeling today. I am always moderately dissatisfied with one thing or another. I think I am simply hardwired that way. No drugs, no food, no sex, no love can cure this feeling. It is what it is.

yes yes yes. wow. reading that just made me feel so much better.

I feel like my whole addiction was all about that. ""high"" meant ""satisfied"", to me. when I was high enough, I felt calm and that satisfaction feeling. not for long, of course, but it was a feeling amazing enough to keep chasing. satisfied, content = happy.

now, 7 months after quitting dope, I am happier and way more grounded, of course, than I was during active addiction, but still always chasing that satisfaction thing. it seems to be the one thing I want in life so badly. maybe I will just always be like this and need to learn to live with it

"Ahh yes, the story of south 4th and Marcy ave.

I had been sick all day and I finally found a come up.  I was gonna middle some bars for some girl and then I could get right. Get her the Xanax. She gives me 1mg as a thank you and because I was visibly so fucking sick.  My dealer gets back to me and I go grab a bun with said girl in tow.  

Now I'm covered in sweat shaking gagging, gonna die. Approaching death. So I make use of a Mexican food spot a block away from my dealers to shoot.  I also knew that these bags were gonna be really good and really big but for some reason I still choose to do two more bags than I normally would have.  I bang bang and I'm able to clean out my rig and put very thing away and walk out of the bathroom. I'm able to take 3 steps out the front door and than *bbbbllllaaackkkk* CUT SCENE!

I wake up in the amber lamps and immediately realize what's happened and let out a ""fuuuccckkkkkkkk"" the emts laugh at me and confirm my suspicions. I ask them how much narcan it took and they said 3mgs.  I was still high and I thanked them for giving me as little as was necessary.  They were like ""how do you know about narcan??"" I just laughed and said ""I been in this game for years, I wrote me a manual.""

Supposedly I exited the building and stared drooling and while my friend was trying to help me walk and I just face planted.  While my xannied out drunk friend was running the options a stranger walked up and asked what was wrong with me? My friend just said ""heroin.""  That person said ""Jesus, what are you waiting for?"" And called da amba lampse.

Now I owe tons of money to woodhull they'll never get.  I didn't have to get high for the rest of the night.  In the hospital they hooked me up to a banana bag and let me and the girl rest between two dusted out gumshot patients who were fighting the doctors and whatever shadow people who were around.

Good times, I wish I could say that was the last time. Only time with an amber lamps. I think I'm going on 6 now.  It's sorta weird knowing how you'll die, but whatever.

"I'm Bipolar I and I self-medicate with opioids when I can find them and sometimes kratom. I find that they help both phases of the disorder - they lift me up out of deep anxiety and depression, and they calm me down and stop the delusions when I am manic or feeling at risk of psychosis. I believe that opioids are uniquely effective for Bipolar - they're not the only drugs that work, but they work fast, and they actually make you feel good instead of chemically straitjacketed.

That said - I am very careful not to indulge so much that I experience significant withdrawals. Opioid withdrawal makes every Bipolar symptom worse - pain, psychosis, irritability, horrible RLS, depression, anxiety. So if you don't have a prescribed supply or the ability to control your usage I would really recommend against it. I use them as sort of emergency meds - a few times a month usually, not for weeks in a row, and check myself if I feel like escalating the dosage. If I feel like I can't stop I usually find that I need my Bipolar meds adjusted or something in my lifestyle is out of whack. Occasionally I really freak out about the possibility of addiction but I've been doing this for ~5-6 years now and gone through mild withdrawal a few times so I know that I do *not* want to end up with a serious habit and that if I did I would have to swear off opioids forever.",conbvr6,opiates,1424115309,LurkOne,2,0

"*DO NOT* leave the tourniquet on! That will cause burst veins and leakage like you are describing, not to mention it will kill your veins super fast! Take it off and then register again to check that you are still in, then push down the plunger. I think that is your issue here. If you are having issues staying in the vein, try attaching a key ring to the plunger so you can stick your finger in it.

"Yeah it really sucks how other a lot of other subs (not all) demonize opiates to the point that they'll realize anti-drug propaganda is BS for some other drugs, but never think to question the myths about opiates. It's always really vague, too, like ""heroin will kill you"" and when you try to explain that, other than the risk of OD and risks associated with improper injection, heroin doesn't necessarily harm you (although bad cuts can), they say things like ""don't try to say something so ridiculously absurd like that, I've known heroin addicts and you can tell it's slowly killing them every day"". 

They never say exactly how, other than ""it saps their energy"" or ""fries their brain"". I'm sure they'd be amazed if they knew how many people they knew who are energetic and sharp, and just happen to be addicted to opiates.

It's really frustrating because for every peer-reviewed research journal you cite that begrudgingly admits opiates don't really pose much risk long-term physically, there's a hundred official looking government, anti-drug organization, or even rehab/treatment center websites that say all sorts of lies about opiates for them to paste in reply. And it's SUCH an example of propaganda that has been terrifyingly effective that from the start of the argument you've already lost, because all they have to say is ""you're claiming that heroin isn't damaging to the body, just listen to yourself"" and everyone will agree because ""it's HEROIN! it's deadly! it just IS, because it's HEROIN!"" 

The worst part is that when you argue in favor of legalization of opiates (including heroin), even with restrictions, you can't honestly deny the REAL risks associated with STREET heroin, unless you want to be dishonest and stoop to their level...and that SHOULD be an argument in FAVOR of legalization, but they use it in this twisted, circular logic argument, that heroin can be hard on the veins (because of certain things it can be cut with) and that overdoses can be deadly (it's VERY rare for addicts to accidentally overdose if they know the exact amount they're taking, unless other drugs are mixed in), and so it should stay illegal. They literally claim that because street heroin, as a result of its illegality, is or can be dangerous, it should stay illegal ""because it's dangerous"".

"Chronic back pain and neck pain + headaches is a hell of a way to live. Been barely functional for the last week trying to get by on dabs alone (did wonders for my tolerance though). My buddy's script came today, and his doctor didn't tell him. They gave him 10 more pills per month and upped it from 5s to 10s (80 for me 40 for him), and for the same price to boot. Then my buddy who owed me for fronting him to pay for a repair on his car stopped by with 25 bars.

"That is bullshit. If you are 9/10 pain and they want to cut you off... that is ridiculous. This is how pain patients end up turning to heroin etc. What do they tell you to do instead?

Tolerance is NOT the same thing as addiction. ANYONE who uses for a certain length of time (typically 3 weeks+) will be physically dependent. My husband and I were using the same amount of pain pills for the same amount of time (months) and while we both had w/d when we stopped, I can honestly say that I was/am addicted and he was/is not. 

Even if you were addicted, that also DOES NOT cancel out your need for real relief. And I don't care how many junkies take advantage of the medical system, that is no excuse to deny even one hurting person their medication. 

I am in a similar predicament and asking for similar advice... Seems that straight up asking about a pain contract could be the way to go, assuming you aren't already on one. They UA you and count your pills (depending on your state) to monitor your use, which is annoying, but it is a way for the doctors to keep records and 'prove' you are a legit patient. Just be honest and explain that you have developed some tolerance but the pain keeps you from functioning. If that doesn't work, ask for a referral to pain management, although I hear that is a pain in the ass. Really just say what you've said here. If you truly aren't an addict you shouldn't have to worry about saying the wrong thing. (Just don't mention dependence or withdrawal, just tell them that when you don't have the meds you are in unbearable pain, which unfortunately sounds like it's true.)

I had to do it again today, at night time cause I couldn't get out of the house in the day time... The guy that hooked me up yesterday would not answer his phone, ugh I hate that shit! But I drove around down town and stopped at this sketchy ass gas station, and apparently a little white girl in that part of town that late looks kinda funny, and the guy working the counter said you doing ok and I said no and the first thing he says is what are you looking for? I tell him and he says come back later he might can help then, this black dude is walking in as I walk out and he comes out while I am pumping gas and says you lookin for H? I said yeah and he said follow me! 

So I have had really good luck the last two days, the only bad part is it hadn't been that great, it gets me well, but that's about it... I have been snorting it though because my boyfriend has been on the lookout for tracks since he caught me cookin up one day about a month ago...But congrats to you on finding the fire!! :-)",cot8xne,opiates,1424588795,ironoxysweetie4,1,0

I have a 6 year old son, who is the most amazing thing in the world and deserves better than a mom who uses.

   When I was 12, I was told that the ""sickness"" I was told my father had, the sickness that kept him away from the house for months at a time. The sickness that made him bust down our front door so many times that you could see the sunlight shine through. The sickness that made him steal our Christmas presents, that the church donated to us, by mid January. That made him lie and cheat and steal. That made him break the hearts of my little brother and little me. That the sickness, was actually an addiction. ""An addiction to crack and cocaine."" Those words, and the ones they failed to use, have sent me down a path I never wanted. 
   So when I started experimenting with drugs in junior high, I made sure to stay away from coke. When I made new friends and partied all through high school, I stayed away from coke. When I destroyed my liver and reputation throwing down with all the kids at collage, I stayed away from coke. I stayed away from coke, but I embraced the opiates, and they embraced me.

   It wasn't until after my dad was found with the needle still in his arm, and my big brother and I drove through the slums to try to find his belongings, waiting around to identify the body of a man who was left for, approximately, three days before anyone was called. Which was only months after my mom passed away. After I developed a pretty solid opiate romance, that they told me his drug of choice was lady heroin. HA! 
   I spent the entirety of my life of drug use avoiding these drugs that, I was told, my dad ruined his life for. I actively embraced the Percs, the 10's, the blues, the bags, the bundles, the lines, the needles, the rush. 
So now, here I am. Days of laying in bed tossing and turning, only moving to rush to the toilet, just soaking in my sour sweat. I don't blame a single sole for the position I am in, because that is all my own. But if my mom would have just told me the truth, and I would have avoided opiates like the plague they are, I wouldn't be here right now. I would be shooting bows and arrows instead of dope, building Lego cities, running and jumping and enjoying my sons youth, instead of watching him grow up from my bed. 
I will be completely open and honest about my drug use with my kid... When the time is right. He is still young and I am still sick. But when he gets to the age where he is making decisions to alter his mind, he needs to know how it runs in the family and how easy it is to throw your entire life away if you let yourself. Untill then, I will keep trying to get clean and NOT being my father. 

I think it is extremely important to be honest with your kids about these kinds of things. I wont be telling him every detail about every score, but He deserves to be armed with the knowledge to defend himself from the demons hes inherited from me.",cohiklx,opiates,1423608439,skankzilla,5,0

So I am drunk as fuck and laying on my floor.  I tried to call my landlord earlier but he was giving me the run around and trying to say I owed him the money TODAY.

As a goodwill offering I suggested I GIVE HIM 6 cans of beer which he promptly took and then he told me to have it by next monday.

Guys I am really concerned I will not be able to get the money by that time. I really don't know what to do.  I can't be homeless.  I mean I can try and camp but I really am afraid of the woods and bears and stuff like that.  Plus I don't know how I will hook u my electricity out there????

"Sorry for the book. When I'm high I type sooo much shit. 

My guess is you were given the standard dose of 8mgs? There's a select lucky few whose receptors hate bupe from the beginning. Then there's others like me whose receptors are so desensitized from doing heroin for over half my life along with long term suboxone that they see bupe similarly to naltrexone. This happens to those who've been on long term mmt too.

If you have trouble inducting obviously you need to wait a long time and start with low doses. The micro dose + heroin method is the only way I can induct now and it works really well. My suggestion though is that after two weeks to slowly lower your dose to 2mgs/day. Many others as well as myself have found that bupe works much better at lower doses. I guarantee that you will feel much more opiated and will every so often find yourself nodding all night long. In many cases 8mgs is too high of a dose for this to happen except for at the beginning of maintenance. Whatever you do don't shoot suboxone. It's much worse for you than most people realize and the damage is permanent. 

Disclaimer for angry people who disagree with me. As always I've made some generalizations. I'm sure many people have had a different experience but on the whole I believe my assumptions to be accurate. It's pretty much impossible for someone in the US to have been taking suboxone longer than I have. It's been well over a decade and I've learned a lot over this time. In fact the things I've come to understand about it now directly contrast my previous strong opinions from when I had already been on maintenance for over 8 years. Bupe is a weird ass fukn drug and really does a number on your receptors the longer you take it. If my experience is anything to go by it will also turn you into a giant fucking weirdo. But maybe bupe didn't have anything to do with that.",coaffim,opiates,1423012457,ProllyChris,2,0

If you have no gabapentin tolerance it doesn't take that much to help mask WD. Gabapentin is a fantastic glutamate blocker, and rebound glutamate is the source of the other issues, like noradrenaline overload (sweat, restlessness, chills, goose flesh, the shits).

You might even sleep if it's your first time with gabapentin.

Try to taper off when you're done, even for a short spell. Doesn't take much to trigger rebound stuff from the gaba.

I'll be on 1200mg or so for 3 days then taper down 200mg per day.

"Hello, first I think its great that youre doing this! Thank you, on behalf of r/opiates. 
So my questions (sorry if redundant, common sense ones)
1. Ive heard from countless users that if you IV long enough your pretty much gauranteed to get it, like from yourself. Meaning just shooting up long enough can develop it. Sounds ridiculous I know but ive heard this from 3 different ppl. Any truth? 
2. If it goes untreated for years, does it worsen the condition? I ask this because I (27 F) joined a methadone clinic about 2 yrs ago and they do initial testing of.course and they hilighted some results on my paper, said there were some outliers I suppose would be the best term in my enzyme numbers and this could be indicative of HepC and to get checked. I havent yet, is this going to make it worse if there is anything? (the waiting) 
3. What are the main symptoms of HepC? Like if you have ""a, b and c"" go get checked becuase.its likely. 
4. Is it life threatening? In which case would you see a death? 
5. Any hollistic treatments, vitamins, or home remedies that assist in the battle with HepC. 
6. What is the largest detriment caused to a normally healthy body? 
7. Can an otherwise healthy person (maybe a little malnourished) live a productive, long life even with HepC, if it was diagnosed and treated relatively young?

He was drunk which was immediately a bad sign and when we went and I was blowing him, he took forever to get hard which he blamed on the coke he apparently did also. Now I'm in the passenger seat trying  to blow him. He decides to reach under me and grab my dick and yank on it. Then when I'm not hard immediately and about to tell him to stop because it's painful he says "" fucks wrong with you, your dick don't work or somethin?""  I told him it was the angle and refrained from flipping out. Anyway after a bit he was like sorry I dont think I can cum. I said ok but i need that money still because the reason you couldnt cum is because of what you did not because I was bad and I spent time doing it. What does he  say? Oh I was never gonna pay you I have no money. I was like bro what the fuck are you kidding me and started getting loud with me. I had a knife in my pocket and the guys like what you wanna fight and I said yea and he gets out and comes around the other side. When he did I noticed he left a nice looking phone in the middle of the seats. I quick grab it and when he comes around and grabs me I say jeez man forget it ill leave and just start running. Problem was I had a broken toe so it was like the crippled gait but I wanted to get out of sight so he couldn't run my ass over when he found the phone missing. 

Phone was an iPhone 4 but it was locked and I didn't want to risk getting  fucked over it because I know iPhones aren't exactly good to sell when stolen. Funny thing was a reminder for probation the next day(hope he failed his piss test) and he tried calling a few times later. Fuck him I threw his phone in the street.

I put an ad on craigslist that specifies I only want oral and am looking for an older guy. I say older because they are willing to pay for a ""hot, young guy"" much more often than a young guy is willing to(though it does happen). When they email me(I get like 30 emails in an hour or two usually, literally as soon as it appears someone immediately emails me) I respond saying hey I'm sorry but I need some monetary help or something like that. They either don't respond, say hell no/call me a piece of shit whore etc. Or the best 2 words I can see in writing. ""how much"". I very much dislike giving a price because some people are willing to pay do much more than others so I try to get them to give a price first and try to get a bit more out of them if I think I can. If they say they will give me 100+ though I say yes nearly every time as long as they don't ask for too much.

Sometimes I tell him that I just need extra this time and next time I won't need anything but naturally when I see him next time something new has come up. He has actually taken me to cop dope 3 times without  even realizing it. I said I had to pay back my friend because he loaned me money before I saw the tickler and I needed the money fast so I could turn my phone back on or whatever bullshit I come up with. 

Tickler also straight up gave me 1 expensive electronic device because mine was old(ended up using it as collateral one night to cover 50 bucks due to seriously bad thinking due to drugs I was on and I haven't gotten it  back yet and another time bought me a brand new device when mine broke. Not going to specify what they are as the details could possibly give me away to like one person and I'm not taking  that chance, despite how remote a possibility it is. 

So yea, I honestly have no idea why these guys like me so much. Like the  guy I just saw(180 woot! That's a record for him) I understand because even though I don't do a lot, he is the one in charge for sure and since he has the master/slave fantasy I need to let it be that way. Thankfully for him all the talk of beating stays a fantasy but he does call the shots and gets what he wants. The tickler on the other hand is so desperate to be my ""friend"" that I basically call all the shots, can ditch him on a whim if I got enough money and don't want to see him that day, if he does anything that bothers me I stop him, if he tickles even remotely as much as he did when he first met me I stop him because I hate being tickled and if I'm high enough  not to be very ticklish or care about it, I hate faking laughing. So he basically just massages my feet and gives me money and things in exchange for me spending a couple hours max at his house watching tv and trying to make the time go as fast as possible.

In my mind, as long as I have dope flowing in my veins, life was perfect. Before rehab, I was severely depressed to the point that waking up and going to class was a fucking ordeal.

 I had horrible agoraphobia and going outside my dorm to the big, bad world made me anxious. I felt inadequate and weird. I was, and still am, uncomfortable in my own skin. When I first tried opiates, my whole life changed. I could talk to people w/o freaking out and I could go to class and impress my professors. Of course, all those benefits went to shut when I progress deeper into my addiction.

The sad thing was that my family trusted me so much back then, that even if I was slurring my words and nodding off, they STILL would think I was sober.

"People usually plug because depending on the drug, it is the closest thing to IV. A drug like morphine is pretty useless unless you plan on injecting it because of low bio-availability through oral use, or insufflation. When you plug morphine, it is actually a worthwhile drug and will get someone high without using a needle. If you're not an IV user this can be very beneficial. I have plugged a couple of times. Once was when I only had a very small amount of herein left, and I wanted to try and get high off of the small amount I had. I do not IV so plugging was the option available to me that would give me the most bang for the buck since the bio-availability is higher than snorting. I get opana fairly regularly and I usually crush the whole pill at once and dose throughout the day. We'll I had managed to get about half of a forty wet and as many people know, opana turns in to a gooey mess when it touches water. I decided to plug that since it was really the only option that was left to me. I do not share the fact that I have plugged with people outside of this sub reddit. To be fair though, I don't really share any of my drug use with people outside of this sub or reddit in general (except for my marijuana use). Plugging can be a decent ROA if you only have a small amount of your DOC, or if you come across a drug like morphine which will not be absorbed enough by the body if taken orally, or snorted.

so super bullshit charge, i lawyered up because i didn't want a record if i was convicted. i would have just had to pay a fine if i was, but i did not want to be denied entry into the US. i spent 2K$ on her but she got the prosecution to drop the case after a 100$ donation.

"I hate to be the downer of the thread but I don't know that everyone else is giving you sound advice. Everything depends on your probation, your officer, your county, your situation. Other people may not have gotten in trouble in their situations but that doesn't necessarily mean anything for yours.

The fact is, getting on suboxone isn't like getting on other legally prescribed medications. It is prescribed pretty much exclusively for opiate dependence. So getting on it is going to be an admission and confirmation to whoever finds out about it that you were a using opiates prior to getting on it.

I don't think it will make a difference whether you go to a private doctor or a clinic. The person who said that it would be better to go to a private doctor because of patient confidentiality - well, the clinic is bound by those same confidentiality laws. And that's all well and good, however, you need to remember that when you are on probation, your rights are not the same as other people's. Your probation officer could ask at any time to see your medical records and to ask what current meds you're on - and maybe it would be up to you whether or not to tell them, but they sure could throw you in jail if they didn't appreciate you not cooperating. The judge in your case sure can get an order to obtain those records. I'm not sure what you were saying about the clinic requiring a paper about your probation - they mean they take the initiative to report it to your PO even before (or if) they ever requested those records? Well that would be kinda silly and then yeah j would probably see a private doctor. But I'm not sure why you would need to tell the clinic you were on probation anyway. But that poster is also right, they are free to make up whatever rules they want, and if their rule is they want you to tell your PO and if they find out that you didn't they could discharge you - well of course they COULD do that I guess. I've just never heard of it being that way.

It seems like you have a few options. You could keep trying to quit on your own, which doesn't seem to have been working. You could get on Suboxone secretly and hope your PO doesn't find out - and maybe they won't and everything would be okay - I faked UDS for drug court for fifteen months and never did get found out. Or you could tell your PO that you are starting on it.

Unfortunately your PO can absolutely interfere with it, though. They can tell you that they don't want you taking it while your on probation and possibly throw you in jail for all the use you've been doing and lying about this whole time (this would be pretty extreme but...they could. and they could take you in front of a judge to back them up). They could be supportive that you came clean and were honest and not have a problem with the suboxone - but they might want you to do other treatment too, like residential, IOP classes, etc. They might be cool and just let you get the suboxone treatment and not give a flying fuck as long as your drug screens were fine and you didn't pick up any additional charges. If it had been me in your situation in my probation programs, they would have been supportive that I was honest and they'd probably let me have the suboxone but they absolutely would have required me to get other treatment besides just medication and they would have required meetings and etc.

The whole point I'm trying to make is that no matter anyone else's experience, YMMV. You got yourself kind of in a shitty situation, because the outcome unfortunately might not be exactly what you wanted. If it were me personally in your situation, I would be honest with your PO up front and volunteer to see a therapist / go to a group as few times a week as I could get away with it, so they would see I was taking the problem seriously. Hopefully because you're in college and have a child they won't wanna mess that all up for you and stuff but remember - hey see it as ""saving your life"", so sometimes they're willing to go to more extreme measures than what you think is necessary. I felt this all the time when I was on probation, that they always went overboad, but while my behavior doesn't seem that risky to me, or other people on this forum, it does to people that don't use drugs.

****

Again though, I apologize. I hate to be a downer. I think you will be okay. But I think too that it's important to clearly understand the situation you're in and how much say probation / court does actually have in your life. Like I said, some of that stuff is extreme,  but it could happen and I have watched it happen to people I know.  But I do think that if you are honest and you show that you are making an honest effort to get well and improve all aspects of your life, that any decent probation officer would support that.",coq2nzf,opiates,1424322965,gravitykoala,1,0

"Are you talking like you want to go sign up for a suboxone/methadone program?

Or buying it off the streets and tapering off that way?

Suboxone and subutex are pretty much the same thing. Like another user said the naloxone in suboxone it's too deter you from shooting it but it really does nothing.

The suboxone strips make it much easier to taper compared to the subutex pills, in my opinion. I started my program at 8mg of suboxone a day. Eventually tapered down to like .25mg of suboxone a day (a sliver of the strip basically) and jumped off there. Had about a week of shit sleep and crankyness but nothing compared to dope withdrawal. 

I honestly feel a 1 to 2 month taper of suboxone works the best going from 6 to 10mg at first and eventually going down to microdoses like I did. If I had to do it all over again this is hands down how I would do It.

"Hey man, from the looks of things, you seem to be very upset and in shambles over this whole situation with your fiance, and rightfully so.

But you need to stop acting like a douchebag to everyone that responds (trying to help you) because you don't like the suggestion they offered.


My suggestion to you for a long-term solution to this is, keep seeing pain-management doctors, psychs, internists etc. You will eventually find one that will be willing to work with your fiance and you on this until her pain is adequately controlled. What you are doing VERY WRONG is going to these doctors and angrily demanding a VERY powerful opiate by name and getting upset and refusing to settle for any less when you are expectantly denied.

The next doctor you see (preferably a pain specialist), explain to them the entire situation with your Fiance. Tell them the operations and procedures she's had, the methods of treatment used on her, the medications she's been prescribed and used. Tell them what worked for her and what didn't, how long she was on it for and how much she was taking. After all of this, ask the doctor what plan he has in mind for treating your fiance. DO NOT fucking ask for any OPIATE medication right off the bat, let alone demanding it by name, because that's a good way to never see that doctor again. You will have to settle for being prescribed very weak medication and working your way up to something that will actually work. It's messed up your fiance has to suffer but this is how the game is played.

For short-term solution, the dark net like others have suggested or copping on the streets. Not everyone who uses opiates whether recreationally or medically is a junky like you seem to think, and your partner won't automatically turn into a junky because you decided to purchase some medication over the internet, now stop acting like you're better than all of us and morally above us all.",conq4nq,opiates,1424140612,KoneyIsland,17,0

"I'm surprised that they even gave her fentanyl at all bc it states right on the box that it is not for short term use, such as after surgery and should only be prescribed to patients who are already opiod dependent and require around the clock pain relief.  While I'm sure she may feel that she needs around the clock pain relief until the docs can find out what the cause is, fentanyl is definitely not the best option for her (since she won't need it long term, etc). Take it from me, I was on fentanyl patches for 4 years after a bad car accident left me with a torn disc, 2 herniated discs, degenerative disc disease, schmoral nodes, etc., etc.  (I had to switch to Oxycontin instead bc I began having irritation from the adhesive after prolonged use)...you become dependent on them very quickly and your tolerance continues to build over time, not to mention they are extremely hard to come off of! So, I highly doubt that the docs at the ER would just slap a patch on her arm and send her on her way! If she has a referral for Pain Mgt, then she'd probably be better off starting with a short acting med like Oxycodone or Dialaudid and increase the dosage as needed, etc. 

I'm not saying this to be a dick, but if you talk to her docs the way you are talking to people in this thread, I'm not surprised they don't want to help. Try to be respectful and explain her situation, or better yet, let her explain it.  Keep logs of her pain levels, symptoms, track weight loss and food consumption (or lack there of)...basically document as much as you can so you have something to show the doctors rather than just demanding a highly addictive medication right off the bat. Unfortunately, pain relief is usually a slow process...docs tend to start off with low dosages and increase if needed. 

With that said, I do hope she finds some relief sooner than later...I know first hand that living with chronic pain can take over your life. Good luck. ",conr5jp,opiates,1424142622,d0pelganger,4,0

"Yeah, like everyone said, they will most likely come soon enough. But, this should be a learning experience for you- if you don't want to experience the WDs and you truly fear them, then try and not raise your usage and keep it low- or even better- quit while you're ahead (I know, easier said than done). You'll eventually feel some sort of WDs regardless of how much you use, because your body gets physically addicted to the drug... so it really just depends on how you go forward with it. And I always see people saying ""I know my habit isn't as bad as what I see on here"" so often... I mean, whatever you have to tell yourself to feel better, but I always feel that it's just an excuse/way to cope and mentally make yourself feel like you're ""not that bad"" ... but when you think about it, doing dope at all is a habit no matter how you look at it, and someone who only does 10 mg of Vicodin a day would look at you and say ""at least my habit isn't *that* bad""... I'm not trying to put you down or be mean at all, I'm just trying to put it into perspective. I feel like that's just a form of denial that sometimes people use to justify their use and feel like they have control. Sometimes people get too comfortable with their habit and let it take over, because ""at least I don't shoot"" or ""at least I don't do a gram a day"" when it easily could come to that point... as long as there's always someone to compare your use to, someone who is always doing more than you where you can say ""at least that's not me"", then you can continue to justify your habit and have the illusion of being in control as the habit worsens.. not saying that will happen to you or that I'm talking about you in particular, I'm just generalizing, but its definitely a way of justifying it.

Because obviously something isn't right.Placebo effect is a real thing so its gotta be that. No matter how shitty the stuff is if its real and you have enough eventually you will get high. without a pic it's impossible to say if it looks normal or fake or whatever.

"Christ where to even begin.

-Never sell dope to one half of a couple. The other one will always find out, and will usually blame you for their habit
-That buddy of yours that says he's a sociopath, but you think is just a harmless pussy posing, actually is a sociopath that'll fuck you over horribly. 
-Don't do hard drugs with people that are family friends, especially if they're really dramatic and have big mouths. 
-You're very attached to your old skating friends, and it'll hurt very badly to lose them. 
-Don't steal from work, because you're friends with your bosses, and these people really are giving you chances you barely deserve.
-That bitch is clearly stringing you along. Just give up now. Cause otherwise she'll insist on driving and catch everyone in the car a case. 
-Don't wait in a shady alley in Upper Darby for two hours, and if you do, when you see the cops waiting for you, don't try and drive home. 
-At one point J____ was a good friend of yours. Now that he's a junkie, he's gonna be a dick about everything. Just stay out of it.
-Don't spend your whole unemployment check on dope. Go back to school or do something worthwhile with this time.
-Buy stuff you can't pawn. Clothes for example. 
-That ex-coworker that hates you? He doesn't have dope in his hick ass white trash town. He's just gonna rob you.  
-Just cause someone's a Dominican blood from NYC doesn't mean he knows a fucking thing about heroin. Ye god was that some trash.
-D___ is an utterly worthless dickhead that'll fuck you out of every cent he can.

But she unloaded the 300+ purple 30's she still had to me for not much money at all. She offered so I didn't feel bad, normally I would have if I were to ask someone in that situation. 
Kind of started my opiate use in a heavier sense. Really enjoyed them before but never much in large or often quantities. 
Started by plugging one at at a time, was a very simple prep and administration with a little coconut oil and lack of shame/embarrassment for the act.  With a great high! Very mellow for a solid 6+ hours. So I slowly upped it. 60 was a GREAT high while I kept low tolerance for a handful of months. And in the end 90-120 was still a pretty darn good high and the legs were awesome. I could have a near full day of euphoria off one midmorning rear entry. 

Oral never did much. Eating two at the beginning gave me a very low but still long buzz. And I didn't try sniffing them because of the gelling consistency. Wasn't bad and I'm sure if you snorted a LOT with no tolerance you'd get some effect...but it would be so much materiel that I think it would be a poor choice in ROA. Butt. Shoot. Swallow.

"Precipitated withdrawals. 

There are two instances that immediately come to mind. One was terrible because of the situation: my dude springs the fact that he's out on me the NIGHT BEFORE I was supposed to go on a week long trip for work. So I scrambled, tried to get an 8th of dope but it was too short notice. Left with subs, dosed too early, got sick. In the morning I drove a Ryder truck for six hours (taking buckets of stomach meds, speed, and xanax). Taking the benzos was retarded but I was losing my mind stuck in the cab of this truck, so it made sense at the time. Physically: only maybe 5/10 on the withdrawal scale. But god damn, being in that truck was fucking misery. 

But that still pales in comparison to full blown precips. 

I'd been taking huge amounts of fentanyl and morphine on a pretty good month binge. I'd planned to jump onto subs for a while to take a break (save money, ect), but I didn't do my usual taper onto subs (bad idea) and just figured I'd do it the normal way. 17 hours after my last dose and I'm feeling pretty sick. Now I really don't want to go into PW so I take a ""tester"". Just a little bit of sub to see how it reacts. I wait an hour and it doesn't seem like the sub made things worse so I should be good to go. 

I take a quarter dose (2mgs). Not even the full 8mgs I needed. 4 minutes later and it hit. If you've never had precipitated withdrawal it's hard to describe just how fast and strong it hits you. Like a wave of horror rushing through your body. The physical stuff is easy to understand. Just imagine it ten times worse and coming on in seconds. Pupils dilate, sweat pours out, bowels completely liquefy in seconds, your legs start thrashing out of control, nausea, hot and cold to extremes. All the usual, just amplified by ten. 

The insanity that engulfed my mind was something else though. The massive anxiety was amplified by the shock and dread of realizing what I just did. That feeling of making a truly horrible mistake combined with everything else. It made me insane. Crying, screaming, thrashing, running around with no idea what to do. Riding it out was NOT an option. This was literally unbearable. My mind and body are screaming at me to make it stop. Do anything. Just make it stop. And this was all in ten minutes time.

Luckily I managed to find a connect that was able to bail me out on a moments notice. If that hadn't happened I would almost certainly have killed myself. The only way I was able to wait the hour for him to arrive was to lay in the shower.

"Depression should be noted as a very common side effect when coming off of opiates. Waking up in the morning with withdrawal sucks but with the added depression it makes it nearly impossible to not grab my keys and go pick up. I know you might not be in full withdrawal with your taper, but lowering doses is still enough for you to get the side effects - just not as powerful.

I'm also not trying to deny you have depression. You very well could. I would try to get two weeks completely clean and go from there. If the depression is still a problem - TALK TO SOMEONE. I'd recommend a seeing a doctor if it's bothering you that much by that point.

All in all, I just want to say whether doing it cold turkey or weaning off - depression will naturally set in for most addicts. We love our opi's and our brain is chemically dependent to them - alter that some and your brain is all like ""What the hell man?! We been feeling good for ages and now you just want to throw of my chemical balances?! That makes me sad, and in turn makes you sad""

According to the last PM doc I saw, ""Morphine/Hydromorphone and similar drugs are reserved for cancer patients and end-of-life care."" I had to actually educate him on CYP2D6 deficiency and that just because I don't metabolize codeine/codeine containing meds worth a damn does not mean all other opioids are null and void as well (I could not believe how arrogant he was, I had to print off documents showing the data and even then, he was an ass about it). He also said he'd be more than willing to sign whatever needed to get me on disability (my husband was pissed and considers that borderline fraud; I don't *need* to be on SSD when a simple medication daily could make it so I could live and be a productive member of society). And before he walked out, he said he was *sorry* that he and most other doctors in this area are so conservative and to search the internet for doctors who prescribe such drugs. I had rage, nausea, and the feeling of going damn near postal right then and there. I'm still thinking about it, and that was about a month ago. 

My husband has come in with me on several appts to different doctors and attested to our own lack of a sex life, him having to be a parent and a half, his own terror and concern about my declining health, physical abilities, anhedonia, and how I've gotten worse over the past decade. We've brought paperwork from the Mayo Clinic that said, without directly saying narcotics, that I *require* proper pain management. But FUCKING LUCKY ME!

Just curious. Also it kinda seems like what youre saying is that just because a doctor scripts you 60mg oxy/day for a month, you wont get addicted. Honestly, i feel like if a doctor is prescribing anyone over an equilvalent dose of like 10mgs of hydrocodone a day for more than 2 weeks, youll feel like shit when you run out of your script. And the higher that dose is, the worse you will be. Edit: and not trying to bash you, just saying what i got out of the broadcast lol. And hyrdocodone is the lowest end of the ladder.. thats what i started on for back pain at 15 (yes 15). I was put on it by my family doc for multiple issues for months at a time. The first script i fell in love, and no i wasnt abusing it because i only needed 10 to 15 mgs to get a high and 10mgs was my dose until i was quickly raised to oxy 15s until i was 17. I was never weened off, but i also never told the doc about my addiction i didnt know i had.

Try not to go cold turkey. It's almost impossible to taper by yourself, but you should at least try. What I would do is I would watch something on Netflix.

"I'm going to take the unpopular stance here, and say casual use is possible as long as it's treated with respect. I have friends that used to use opiates recreationally and never became addicts.
I think it's hard for a lot of people on this sub to be objective. Just because I'm an addict, and can't regulate my use to just once a month doesn't mean you won't be able to.

That being said, be careful. It seems like you already have an idea of how insidious opiates can be. If you want to experiment, set yourself up with a schedule, and stick to it.


Wait a month between doses, or whatever. But stick to what you pick. As long as you don't trick yourself into breaking your schedule, you'll be fine.

Opiates ARE really addictive, but I don't think it's as bad as they're sometimes portrayed on here. Like ""oh if you do opiates eventually you're going to be an addict it might take a month or five years but eventually you'll be hooked""...I don't think so.

"Actually, I believe the shitty picture taken in the car was a different batch of heroin/crack. The heroin was darker but pretty much the same quality (it always is here), the crack however was better. The 2 better pictures have that soapy translucent looking crack, which was still pretty good. If I recall correctly the good pictures feature about 1.5g of heroin, and $100 slab of crack. 

I'm not sure if other MI dopeheads would agree with me but I find heroin, as long as it's still rocked up, to pretty much always be of the same quality. Granted I've had some batches that varied, I've never done a regular sized shot and had my dick in the dirt, nor have I ever done a regular shot and been disappointed.

I have noticed some different effects though. A few times I got shit in Detroit that gave me these weird headaches, and also made me more nauseous than normal. The one time the dope was really dark, like mud looking shit, with black specs. The other time it just looked like regular dope.

Got some shit through my friend's connect (my regular connects ""cousin"") and it was this really light colored shit (similar the the color of the dope in the 2 pictures) except it was kind of soft/wet/clumpy. Gave me a crazy pins and needles burn in my face/hands. The people I was with claimed it to be better than the regular shit but I found the actual quality to be the same. Shit like that sometimes leads people to think the dope is better, the same way that coke cut with lidocaine sometimes makes people think it's bomb shit simply because it makes them really numb.

Any saginaw or mid michigan dopefiends feel free to message me. I live in Tuscola County right now but cop/hang out/work in Saginaw. I used to only cop in Detroit because the saginaw dope was so expensive and cut to shit. Since I got out of prison they seem to have got their shit together. $140 a gram is normal, compared to $90-$120 in Detroit. Shit it used to be $200 a gram in Saginaw for some straight bullshit. In my experience though Detroit guys give better deals on bulk. The saginaw guys won't go much lower than $130-$135, even if you're dropping $300-$500 like I often do.

Note: I don't actually have a habit. I have a retarded ass tolerance and couldn't afford a dope habit for the life of me. I can run through a gram in a night. Usually no matter how much I buy, even if it's 2 grams, I only wake up the next day with one mild shot left. 

Love the speedballs though, I'm not super huge into the coke IV rush like my ex-gf, I only like to do 1-3 shots of crack then I'm fuckin' done. Crack/coke is really expensive in saginaw though, I typically shoot $10-$20 worth, $20 is a fucking bellringer for me. Back in the day a $6 or $7 shot of coke was a bellringer though. Usually when I cop I spend about 85% on dope and 15% on crack. Like if I buy a gram and half of dope for $200 I'll get a $30-$40 rock to go with it.",cosy0hw,opiates,1424563766,valuum,1,0

"A little over 8 months ago, I watched a guy I was dating die of a heroin overdose right in front of my eyes, in my very own bedroom. I tried to save his life, but I fell short. We weren't together for very long when this happened, so I think that fact alone is what has saved me a lot of heartache...but the way I look at it, a beautiful tortured soul very much similar to me died that day, and that is an absolute tragedy. He had been clean for about 2 months before this, kept talking about how he wanted to stay sober with me and do things differently, and then things just changed one day and he wanted to use again. It's baffling to imagine how that happens. Did that relapse really just pop up out of nowhere, or had the thoughts been festering for a while, threatening to boil over at any time? I guess I will never know. All I know is that we went from having motivation to stay sober together to him all of a sudden wanting to use again, and I wasn't strong enough to step in and say no. And I wasn't smart enough to just call the paramedics right away when he fell out, I thought I was capable of saving him myself, plus I had dope to get rid of and it went right up my nose before anything. 

All I can really tell you is to go see a therapist and talk about this. That's what I did immediately. Thankfully I already had a good therapist working with me, so I was able to rely on her when this whole mess went down. I did 2 intense sessions a week for a straight month before I felt even somewhat better. I can't even imagine how I would have dealt with this if I hadn't been seeing my therapist. Another thing that helps is telling other people your story. Inspiring people to be strong feels really good when you're hurting from a loss, it makes you feel like there is at least some good that can come out of a shitty situation. When I was in rehab, I talked about my experience all the time and it felt good to put it out there. I just heard from a friend of mine from rehab yesterday who reached out to me because her boyfriend had just OD'd and was in the hospital currently, dying. If I had not put myself out there in hopes of helping others (and myself), she might not have had anyone to reach out to, she might just feel completely alone. So I feel like my way of coping with this, by talking about it when I need to, has benefited not only me but others as well.

Here's my question. Would someone who doesn't use opiates and is really opiate naive even notice someone's pinned eyes? Before I used myself I never saw anyone and thought pills or heroin. I just wouldn't recognize the signs or I would think it was something else. Maybe she was just a bitch.  At work sometimes I'll be too high and if there are complaints it is always that I came in so tired. I'll be nodding out at my register and I really can't believe I'm not fired for being so obviously high or at least made to take a drug test...Point being if someone doesnt use opiates than the last thing they would think is probably that the person is high on anything other then weed and thus has no reason to be judgmental.

Happy valentine's to you, I've gotten so much hate on this thread.

Wow, I should have used some discretion and edited my post rather than just barfing up all my feelings on stims and expecting a good reaction. ~~I don't think people are capable of dealing with lengthy writing on here... it's like, idk what it's like, but it's a shame.~~ I think they're assuming that since my post is so wordy, I must've just like sent her the most insane screed about sexual weeping when in reality i sent a pretty normal sex related text and she's fucking schizo or something 

Whether it's why she decided she won't be seeing me anymore or not, I honestly believe she either is diagnosed with some mental issue that involves serious, irrational paranoia without being treated successfully (she's intelligent, with a masters in a relatively hard science from a good school, yet her rationality is not saving her from these weird, paranoid worries and concerns), or she just has some condition that causes moderate paranoia, e.g. being afraid to be seen by neighbors (because they're too nosy -- about her having a fucking cig on the patio -- even though the neighbors are across such an unusually wide intersection/road that they may as well not exist as far as her worries about them watching and judging her for smoking. Another e.g., after sharing a very little bit about her family's history/heritage/ethnicity, that type of thing, (she was actually speaking with excitement, which made me happy, about being raised by her grandmother with the 'full island experience'), I asked her for more detail (which detail was her grandmother from? right? pretty normal question...) and she got paranoid (I assume, I can't come up with another explanation) and decided that she could not share any more info about it. 

Bottom line, I sent a perfectly acceptable text about sex to a woman I'd already had sex with...repeatedly...recently...a girl who had mentioned a ""dom that she misses so much"". Ya know, ""The Dom That Got Away"", we all have one of those, right? I mean, come on? S&amp;M is in, but a text that just describes us fucking in a relatively normal and certainly not scary way is a problem?  

Well, on the upside, she served as confirmation of my developing theory that I'm becoming more attractive to some black girls/women. On the other hand, all these black girls/women seem crazy as fuck and are more or less exclusively into white boys, and unfortunately, I haven't gotten to know any of these girls well enough to know what the hell led to that. Either way, unless they're all bad crazy, this is good for me, because I (theoretically sort of white?) can say that I feel about black girls (people) the way Ginger Baker apparently did. I'd love to have some beautiful biracial kids some day. I just need to learn drums like Ginger.

And guess what? As soon as I got back on tinder today, my very first fucking match was another black girl, and she responded to me immediately... The crazy one that dumped me today was obsessed with my hair, I'm going to try and figure out if that is what's with these black girls that are into me... I'd ask the one I was chatting up today, but my phone fucking died and my charger decided to call it quits today, as well. 

Edited: removed what sounded like a mean put-down toward the girl's appearance/physicality re her hair, even though it wasn't meant that way and was just honest. Also removed the word ""b****"", because it's not funny in this context and obviously I have no reason to be angry or mean to her, especially since I think she's fucking mental ill in a way that there might not be some easy FIX for, something we should all thank god exists for our conditions.",colnul5,opiates,1423958030,whataboutudummy,-1,0

I got a couple pills recently and got to take them to the park and run around and just be a person. No pinned eyes, just normal pain patient amounts of drugs. But most of the time I can barely keep the house clean, and I get mad at my kids for making messes because I know I can't stay on top of cleaning it all up every single day. I freelance for a living (web design and writing) and don't make enough money anymore because I can't focus. I sit at my computer readjusting and trying to get comfortable.

"The problem I have with reincarnation and the existence of soul/spirit is that.. just how many are there? If it's infinite then that means there can't be reincarnation because there's a finite amount of organisms. Unless spirits take turns getting reincarnated or some just like to watch me masturbate (fucking perv spirit).

However, if there is only a certain number of spirits, even if many, then what happens 'if' humans figure out how to live on other planets. The number of organisms will increase exponentially.

I think the more simplest explanation is that we're just no different from a bacteria. We don't have souls. There is no reincarnation. Buddhism or anyone that tries to explain our existence is so far from the truth.

Picture an ant somewhere in Africa. It can't go very far. To the ant the entire universe is the continent, or maybe even smaller.  It's perception of the world is limited. The things it can't explain.. it will make some stuff up.

That's the same as us. The universe seem huge to us, but, only because we're just humans. There are a lot of things we will never comprehend. We try to make sense of this world with our limited perception.

If there are more advanced beings, they're probably shaking their heads at our attempts. Like us when watching ants, then we forget about them 5 seconds later.",covvdsu,opiates,1424808075,jubilly,1,0

"Nothing. I have massive anhedonia when not using any drugs.

Or, wait, I guess you could say that I get addicted to misanthropic instrospection... Just sitting around contemplating how boring and shitty the world, and the people in it, are. 

Thing is, I'm not sure whether that's even a bad thing. I think my personalized nihilism is actually beneficial to me -- a sort of benevolent pessimism, a cerebral shield against the world; when there are no inherent values, when nothing is tethered, everything free floating and not subject to objective judgment, I can find a certain sense of peace. All pain and discomfort can be dismissed as irrelevant, as when you look up at the stars and the moon at night and realize the utter futility of life; a sort of absurd embrace of the indifference of the universe. We're small. We die. And then everything ends and nothing ever mattered.

Whether this is a self-perpetuating spiral of cynical misery, or a defense against reality's cruel frigidity, I have no idea... And so, much like chemical addiction, it just goes on... And on... I keep pushing the same button because it's the only one I have.

Yeah. I'm high as fuck on amphetamine right now so excuse my rambling.

"It was a mix of 2 things I guess for me. One was a relationship gone South at the time (we are back together because we are too crazy for anyone else I suppose) the other was legit issues. I started using and abusing slightly, I.e. Like taking extra once a week or less. Then we broke up and that feel good warm fuzzy feeling was my comfort blanket. I'd get high as fuck, play video games for too long, have random hook ups, and pretend my life was great while deep down missing her. I wish I could just stay high forever like every other person here but I can't. I can't afford it and it's not fair to my girlfriend or our kids. I'm going to try quiting again.

 I'm tapering right now have been for awhile. Withdrawals are manageable when I have them. Some lope, some Xanax (I only need .25mg to be effective. I take double and I'm high.) I also take adderall which helps me a shit Ton and I'm prescribed them so I know I'll have them. Add some weed on that and whatever I can take for pain, usually 800mg ibuprofens and a shit Ton of aleve (BTW, anyone know how much is actually ok to take? I'm using about 8 of the 220mg ones a day to somewhat help). 

Honestly, if I didn't have kids I'd stay high. And I'm an amazing dad contrary to what some would probably think. When I am with them I never get too high. No matter how much I take I won't nod or anything. Something about parental instinct probably. I never put them in questionable situations or anything. I won't even take them to my best friends house as he's a dealer even though he would put everything up if they came over, he has almost no traffic except people I know and trust and he wouldn't even sell to them with the kids there. I just don't put them anywhere near that lifestyle. I also can do so much more with them when I'm high. I'm sure everyone knows exactly what I mean. I'm an amazing person when I'm high and even though I'm a good dad while sober or even going through withdrawals I'm super dad while high. 

But I still can't remain an addict because of them. The money I use on drugs could go to more stuff for them, vacations and family trips, toys, just doing stuff in general etc. Also, it's impossible to hide that shit from kids 100% no matter how hard I try. I never want then thinking anything I do is OK. I don't want them to have the life I had growing up or the one I have now. I was going somewhere with this but I forgot so I'll edit if I remember lol.

"Im gay, and I love it haha.  As im only 28, I've had the Internet at my disposable for most of my sexually active life (craigslist for awhile in college until smartphones started bringing grindr/jackd type apps to the forefront of the gay scene in America). I've been offered money hundreds of times to do shit with older men, and have been solicited a number of times as well (I don't make it obvious that im an addict so I usually look like I would have *alot* of disposable income as a young single professional)

Im not exactly sure what my point is, except that I've never been able to do it. No matter how broke I've been, and no matter how hot/sexy/fantasy-type of a man it is, I can't bring myself to pay even if I do have the money available (for some of these little 18-19 year old college freshmen $20 is like ""you can do whatever the fuck you want to me"" sadly, cuz most of them are quality dudes who are just down on their luck at the moment, and I hate to see them selling themselves online just for a fuckin dimebag or like a tank of gas in their car. I'd much rather just hang out with them and fill up their gas tank out of kindness and love. And then maybe see what happens haha. But im usually not the type of guy that 18 year olds go after anymore unless there's some sort of money/power dynamic or fetish in play

So, I am still not making a point lol. I will say, I have talked to a couple of straight guys who are wanting to see what it's like to get sucked off by a gay guy (most of us are pretty good at it lol) or just to watch porn or jack off together. I've done it a few times, but again never with money involved. I just can't do that

I guess my point is- you're a lucky bastard for being able to cash in on a fuck-ton of money that I could've made whilst actually enjoying myself as well haha. Generally speaking, the Internet is a safer place than it used to be, but it's still sketch AF. Please be more careful than you even think you could be man. Im glad you have regulars now and don't have to risk meeting new people often at all- that's def the goal. 

Oh, and also- the feet thing. It's very very very common for gay men to fetishize feet. I was just talking to my BFF (a straight girl) about this the other day. And how weird she thinks it is. I think it's a bit weird too if it goes beyond the actual foot.... Like I do enjoy my man's feet, but we have absolutely zero interest in each other's socks or shoes or bad smelling feet haha. I've always thought it is *so weird* that so many men are into that. There's even one guy who lives in my old neighborhood and his profile pic on grindr is this hella-gay-looking, super sparkly, anime-type drawing of a dude's big feet, and his profile basically said ""all I wanna do is suck your dirty feet and I have the money to make it happen."" Online allllllllllll the time

So once again, congrats for being able to not only keep these men company, but also get the monetary reward as well. Approximately 99% of the gay men i know refuse to do anything of the sort (I have one friend who has a long-distance sugar daddy, it's really bizarre and unhealthy but I've said all I can say without offending him to the extreme)

With that said though, the world isn't your friend.  I believe in due process of law.  I believe that people are innocent until proven guilty.  Being convincted of rape by a jury of your peers makes you guilty.  Being called a rapist by someone DOES NOT make you guilty.

Many of these rape accusations ruin people's lives, even when it turns out the so-called ""rapists"" were actually completely innocent all along. Too often innocent people are the victim of mob justice because someone accused them of a terrible crime like rape.  Sometimes they're physically beaten, sometimes they lose their job.

I would rather let 100 guilty men (or women) go free than to occasionally punish an innocent man.  Now you might very well disagree, and that's completely fine.  However that's the stance I, and the American justice system, take.",coveq0e,opiates,1424770081,anki13,2,0

Quote from first link:
"" Lapse vs. Relapse: There is a major difference between having one slip and having a relapse. A lapse represents a temporary slip or return to a previous behavior that one is trying to control or quit (usually a onetime occurrence), whereas a relapse represents a full-blown return to a pattern of behavior that one has been trying to moderate or quit altogether (Marlatt &amp; Donovan, 2005). If someone is on a diet and trying to lose weight, they might have a lapse if they eat one piece of chocolate cake. If that same person gains 25 pounds while on their diet, they most likely suffered a relapse""",cof5kiw,opiates,1423420608,Casually_Insane,0,0

This is a throwaway so whatever ill post mom identifying details. 170lb male 5-time a week heroin user of a few months. The smack I use is tested at 65%-75% (my batch is tested bt an acquaintance in his work lab, not what the vendor tells me.) I usually dose at 20mg insufflated because I am deathly afraid of overdosing. Today I didn't measure and purposely made the dose a little bit large. I just feel extremely careless and I smoked tobacco which exaggerated the effects and made me scarily relaxed. I feel asleep a few times writing this on my phone. Not vomiting or anything 

Edit: I'd estimate I did 45mg. Is this certainly not harmful to me? Could I do another 15mg? I am starting to realize that maybe this is just the STANDARDS dose of heroin and I just haven't seen how powerful it actually is.

"Funny you say that because up until very recently I would have said the same thing about where I stay.  My only experience with powdered h had always been few and far between and hit or miss to say the least.  I've tried some the was fire as fuck and some that was literally the bunkest shit imaginable and regardless of the quality always hard to come by and super pricey. 

Anyway,  fast forward to the last 2 months and my connect has consistently had some of the most fire powder that I've ever had the privilege of shooting.  Again,  it's def a novelty in LA but I've been able to cop it every single time ive scored for the last two months.  

It's funny because my connect and as a result everyone who hooks thru her refers to this new powdered h as ""china white"" which after seeing many a dope porn post I think would more likely be described by most of you as some high quality ecp but again since powdered h is so few and far between in these parts it's pretty easy to refer to it as china because it's the only type of powder I could even get my hands on if I wanted to because she is the only connect who serves it.  

the best part about this ""China"" I've been getting (well after the massive fucking rush that knocks my socks off literally every single shot) is how amazingly kind it's been on my veins.  Several years of shooting tar has left significant wear and tear to my body. It can take me up to an hour to hit sometimes but this powder has been so fucking awesome on my veins.  Before I'd be lucky to get a handful of good hits for every working vein I was able to find but with the powder I have been getting weeks out of each vein which for tar users with shitty veins  is almost unheard of. One of the most noticeable differences is the lack of acidity. Usually with a tar shot just breaking the skin (even with a brand new needle) is a painful experience because of the dope run off on the needle stinging while penetrated my skin.

"If your pain is legit, can you get on opiates a legit way? I had kidney pain during my first pregnancy and was readily prescribed percocet.

They didn't offer me the right to refuse those tests but sure enough when I told them I didn't want to be tested, they let it go with no questions asked.

"Good thought, but she's divorced and seems to have a pretty healthy co-parenting relationship with her ex (or whatever you call it when baby mamas and baby daddies get along).

Outside of her ex, she's never mentioned abuse, and I actually gave her a pretty damn irresistible opening to discuss such things, without requiring any detail or anything, just a few days ago. 

Even still, I can't imagine how my text could have been a trigger for abuse memories... it was very much not a rough sex sext but rather just a pretty ""vanilla"" (which is how she described ""normal sex"", in a pretty derisive manner, when we first talked about sex) type description of really working her, for her pleasure.

And she told me she missed her 'dom(inant)' which was something I didn't even ask her about after she mentioned it since I didn't see any reason to stir up jealous feelings about a girl I was only starting to get to know. The point is, what kind of girl would miss their former dom sex partner and then be re-traumatized by a description of pretty intense but 'vanilla' sex?

It's possible that she dealt with some overly verbose abusive guy in the past, that's literally the best I can think of!

I feel bad sometimes, but it's weird, nobody can really pin down how they grant the qualification. I only have just under 8000 approved at 100% with one rejection, and 1 hard block because the Requester was a jerk and hardblocked everyone...it was that Gupta asshole that kept posting his demographic bullshit hit under different names and payouts (People get pissed when I tell them I got it when I only had like 3000 approved) One thing I do recommend is to try and get as many qualifications as you can, even if you don't use them regularly. I think it looks good on your account, and must count for something at least...looks better on your hidden ""resume"" maybe,  I don't know
  
I do a lot of high paying surveys (this explains my low number) and large batches of categorization and seo hits. Been doing a lot of Tagasauris lately because the indoor/outdoor, day/night ones are cake on mobile compared to surveys. I love the Google ones that come up every now and then too where you record the ""ok google"" shit. I also do a lot of the actual Amazon Hits when I can get 'em. I used to like Crowdsource before they got weird and changed up their SEO hits...their customer service response ones were a staple for me as well...also Crowdsurfs transcriptions when I'm on PC.  When I actually get into it I only make like $60 a week because some of the best masters batches go really f'n quick most of the time...lol. 
  
Mturk is the shit though for making money online (I've tried explaining it on this sub when people ask about our hustles and how we make our money, but for the most part they don't want to hear it...its kinda cool to see another turker in this sub)  ""and has saved me so many times...I'm worried about the IRS though since I'm not able to pay the taxes on the money I've made because I've spent all of it pretty quick...I hope it doesn't fuck my account up.  
  
I did do a little reading about it though and it's thought that because they usually hand out the qualification every 3 months or so that there are hidden qualification batches that show up a few day/weeks ahead of time and maybe they pick who gets it from there. But really, they're apparently really secretive about how you get it and nobody has figured it out yet.  
  
So, I don't know, man...just keep doing what you're doing, be careful with rejects and maybe do more batches or something. I wish I could tell you more about it, but it's a mystery to us all. I do get a lot of good non-masters hits though in comparison..and to be completely honest my favourite thing about it, and the best benefit about it in my opinion, is not having to deal with any more of those god forsaken fucking captchas...I hate that shit...lol I think you should be able to buy that option though if you don't have Masters..kinda like Reddit gold.

YES! This! I was homeless for about a week. And every night, I slept in Logan's E terminal, since my homeless friend said no one fucks with you there.

A bitcoin costs about $230 US right now, and peaked a while back at around $1,000. Bitcoin price has little impact on making darknet purchases though, because Bitcoins are very highly divisible (up to 8 decimal places, or currently about 1/5,000 of a penny), and most vendors peg their prices to a fiat currency such as the USD or EURO.

"I'm so glad I came across this. Here is a link to my blog that I started to help me overcome the grief of losing my brother to his heroin addiction, just 5 weeks ago.
http://overcomingrief.blogspot.com/

And that is just my emotions, and getting stuff out. Here's the story of my brother, Jesse.(name changed on the blog)

He started out with pills, for a herniated disc in his back. He had an MRI and I'm not sure all exactly was wrong with his back but it was jacked. He was doing construction and working for UPS, so he was in a lot of pain a lot of the time. The pills helped. Then someone told him, hey you know you could be getting real good high from those. So one always up for a good time started abusing his pills. Then something happened, he says after Super Storm Sandy on the east coast pills were so hard to get and insanely expensive on the street. A friend told him, dude heroin is the same shit, and it's so much cheaper. So he started doing heroin. Just smoking it. He was never going to SHOOT it. Then his girlfriend who was a dog breeder was like, if you shoot it it's so much cheaper, better high, and I have an endless supply of cheap needles from having to give the dogs their shots. So he started shooting up heroin. My brother was popular in high school. Star athlete, great at hockey, always had a good looking girlfriend. He always had a smile and EVERYONE loved him. And he just became this isolated, lonely, sad, sad person. His girlfriend left him, he was living at home, quit his job, and wouldn't ever go out with anyone. Then he got on Suboxon and was trying to get his life back in order. After 6 months on subs he wanted to get off it. He was sick of it. He was sure he was fine. Then on January 2nd of this year, he left and we never saw him again. They found him in his car in Newark, friggin' New Jersey. ALONE. He was 28 years old. He was alone for 2 days before anyone found him. This was not how my brother was supposed to die. He told my mom, even while he was shooting up, that he was smart. He always did a ""test shot"", he always used clean needles, he always got his stuff from a good guy. He constantly was saying he wasn't a junkie, he wasn't like ""those idiots""... and yet he died the same way they do. This drug takes over your life. If I could give your brother a message, a message I wish I could have told my brother, it would be, please find something else to live for. There is no happiness here. There is no happiness in that needle. It will rob you of everything, leave you with nothing, until you die alone who knows where. ",cohimf9,opiates,1423608527,worriedsick1984,6,0

God I know that feeling. Even when I was sober I never had the energy to play with my kids enough. I was always in pain and just wanted to go to sleep. I've got knee issues that have caused back issues. Hamstrings way too tight but they keep bull shitting on any surgery. Then I had an accident and now have nerve damage and it made my back way worse. I work construction now so it's even worse. I honestly have no idea what I'm going to do. I can't keep taking pills because I can't afford it, but without something for pain I'm not myself. Adderall does help with this. I still feel the pain but I just don't care. Shit has to get done! Lol. 

&gt;I'm happy to hear any tips but it really is mostly actual pain that is the problem. (There are no words for how mad I am that I can't just get NEEDED pain meds from my doctor.)

Have you tried anything for pain? I know nothing will come close to the pain relief brought by opiates but anything is better than nothing. I take a shit Ton of aleve or ibuprofen and Tylenol to help and take hot showers or a bath before bed. Usually I still can't sleep but my body feels better. I'll either smoke a little weed, drink a small amount or pop a Xanax to ass out. There are several home remedies for pain management as well you could look into. Have you checked into kratom? I've never used it because my dumb ass state likes to make shit illegal but I've heard good things. Within moderation of course. Also I believe there is chronic pain sub reddits or whatever that can probably help.

Everytime I would be in there talking about how unsure I was that I could possibly stay clean for the rest of my life she would immediately snap me back to reality ""Mr.  Por vida,  now what the fuck are you worried about whether you will be able to stay clean 20 years from now. Do you think that is the best use of your energy at this point in your recovery ? Do you think it sounds reasonable for you to be so focused on your life 20 years from now when you should be focused on how you are gonna stay clean for the t St of today? Let's think about this, Your clean right now aren't you? And things are going well with your family when they come to family group each week? You have been getting some positive results from your job searching haven't you? Is today better than what you were doing this time last year? Your not dope sick right? Your not living in your car trying to find a vein without worrying about the cops knocking on your window any second right? So what the fuck are you worrying about the rest of your life when you have so much positive stuff you can focus on happening today? Look your home free for today,  you have a few more hours and then you guys will hit a meeting and before you know it you be going to sleep clean for another night right? Did you ever think you'd have almost 60 days clean even you were sitting in jail this summer? That's an awesome accomplishment and you should be really proud of yourself. Stop fucking yourself up with thought that have absolutely no impact on how you are gonna stay clean for the next 24 hrs.  Ok,  I gotta get out of here,  before you go give me three things you are thankful for today"". 

Again I know how incredibly cliche and cheese the whole just for today thing is but I really did have an epiphany in rehab where it finally clicked why NA puts so much emphasis on the one day at a time mindset.  The minute you start thinking about the rest of your life you've ready lost the battle.  There is not a single one rain who got any significant clean time who thought to themselves,  I'm gonna have no problem with never getting high again for the rest of my life,  let's do this.  They did it just like everyone else,  one day at a time.  ",cow3cuq,opiates,1424820313,NodSquadPorVida,4,0

"Still do your brain and possibly future a favor and do wait a few more years. Don't listen to me, trust science in this one. It will be more fun to mess with that stuff once your brain is fully developed anyway.  Compared to POSSIBLY messing something up for down the line, or mostly just introducing things that addicting before your brain has completed developing. Why cut yourself short just to have a little different fun now? Chances aren't high you'll fuck something up, but why not just avoid it all together for a couple more years? Then you'll learn more before then, maybe even have some better connects, and maybe even cool new drugs! 

If you're getting tired of weed and have a really high tolerance, being sober seems like a form of intoxication compared to the fog you've been living in lately so maybe try it for a couple days or week or something.

"yeah swelling and shit is normal. Even if you hit perfectly some dope can get under the skin from pulling the needle out. One way to minimize this is to let go of the tourniquet before you pull out the rig. I also like to ""jack off once"" after removing the tie, which is to draw blood back into the rig, then inject it again. I only pull back like 10 units or so, then reinject it which kind of flushes the tip. Then I press all the way down on the plunger hard (to get that last little bit of dope out), then release pressure and remove. 

I've found doing this greatly reduces the dope leaking out. Ever pull out your rig and the blood that comes out of the puncture hole is really watery and tastes like dope still? This kind of prevents that.",cosxhvn,opiates,1424562698,valuum,1,0

"Ive got a pure blue pit (will post pic soon), she turned 5 oct 18, and she literally saved life when i was at a low low point, my dad had died a few months prior n was still grieving (in 2012) and i was losing my house, had lost my job, and had gotten a dui all between november 2011, and February 2012. My ex from that time i found out was cheating on me, and my friends were starting to not talk to me cuz of my using, so i said fuck it i can fix this. I robbed a genuinely very sweet girl for a 10-pack o' blues, talked to some family about getting help as a last resort and when i felt that even they werent there for me, i loaded my 40 cal with one bullet, wrote a note, spread out a tarp and some towels(so as not to stain anything and make it easier to clean up) and started smoking the last 3 berries i had left. O had that gun in my mouth until i was drooling before i took it out the first time, i edited the note to clear up a couple things, pit it back int mouth hoping to just nod out n pull the trigger, i wiped some more drool off my cheek and tried to wipe it on my leg but guess what, a big square pitbull head was in my way and then it dawned on me, who was gonna take care of her? I couldnt bring myself to take her with me, so i tried to think of the best candidates for her i. Case the first pick wouldnt take her,  and she curled up on the couch next to me with her head on my lap, fell asleep and started her cute and obnoxious snoring and was laying on the damn gun! I couldnt bare to wake her up to shoot myself. If ya'll knew my dog (three of you redditors have met her) youd know the bond we have and it hit me that shed be sad as fuck if i never came back to her one day.. Nothing else mattered to me at that point, not my mom, bro, sis, friends, grandparents, not one human being did i care about leaving but i couldnt stand the thought of my dog not knowing where i was waiting for me to come home n keeping her wondering (since i couldnt explain it obviously)

Yes: HCV can be cured! It always could, but the treatments weren't as successful: Maybe 50% or so (some more, some less, depending on HCV genotypes). Plus, the virus would often bounce-back--called viral relapse--after treatment. So, we called it ""sustained virologic response, or SVR. IF someone had no virus, or an SVR, 6 months following the end of treatment, they were considered cured.

The new treatments are even more effective: In some cases 98% of people get cured after 12 weeks of treatment and the virus almost never bounces back. 

I am consciously saying the word cure to get it out there: Too many people don't think there is one, so I want us to keep saying to change the perceptions out there that there is no cure or no hope! We can wipe this virus off the planet if we test, treat and cure everyone with it.

"Ya. This is *extremely* good advice. Your worst enemy in this situation is tolerance, no doubt about it. Don't raise the dosage/strength (I don't know how this is done with PST btw, never done it) under the strictest way ever. Like.... You could maybe even lessen your use to only once/month for 4-5 months and your tolerance will lower dramatically and you can get good and high off a smaller-than-original-dose

I dunno, I guess I should also say that like I mentioned, I've never done PST nor do I know almost anything about it; So, listen to people who have done it for sure lol

You're lucky to still have such control right now. To be totally honest, in answer to your wonderings on whether or not it can be done occasionally- this is *your* chance to make sure *you* can still do this occasionally. I would love it if I had the self control to use once a week or less!!! So take advantage of it! Lower your tolerance, keep your body as opiate naive as possible. While lowering tolly you could maybe use weed, small amounts of benzos possibly, booze, etc, to help with any minor wds or cravings while tapering down. 

All in all, good luck!! I like this reddit community, I spend far more time on this account than on my ""IRL"" account. Im probably a little less into the game than it could seem by how much/what I post, but, im sure you'd be quite shocked at how ""normal"" I am except for this one little beautiful flower with the nectar of the Gods themselves inside. Lol

The reason I offer such strong advice is because there are two ways to go: the first is what is just talked about above. The second revolves around the idea that you allow yourself to increase your dosage rapidly. This will certainly take away your control more quickly than you think, and you could easily find yourself entranced by the sweet sticky juice of our beloved poppy

"I didn't want to get into this at first, but I've lucked out and found a buyer for some N64 games and just got home after picking up up 10mgs of dilaudid...when I first posted this, withdrawal was just starting to get into the red. I just did me shot, so, here we go.    
  
I've never been a huge fan of semantics. I feel like you understand what I'm trying to say, but you're gonna make me say it anyway. For the sake of discussion, and other people reading this, I'll try to keep it simple. I too have been formally educated on this subject...lol. 
  
When you get into the subject on a basic level it's generally understood that while ethics apply to a wider range, and is more dependent on societal views, morality, for the sake of discussion leans more towards a personal ideology and  your own feelings in regards to right and wrong, legal issues aside since they don't have much place here. The point, and my reasoning for using ""ethical boundaries"" in my title was because I was interested in this on a wider scale, not just in relation to my personal ideas of morality and how *I* feel about it.  
  
As I've stated in another response, as drug users/middlemen and dealers alike, we operate in a massive grey area in regards to what is generally accepted as right or wrong. One could even argue that as filthy drug addicts, everything we do is unethical and we have zero sense of morality to begin with on the simple basis and widespread view that in our society, drugs are bad to begin with, but that would be wrong of them in our eyes, simply put, because being a drug addict doesn't make us any less human, or less intelligent than them. Drug addicts or not, most people have a code of ethics shared among like minded individuals that we live and try to stand by...this can relate to pretty much anything we do, whether your/we're working a regular 9-5, selling dope, or like myself, playing middleman to support my habit.  
  
A lot of the time some of this just kind of blends together and while there are a lot of similarities, what is generally regarded as right or wrong on a moral level personally doesn't necessarily fit into the category of what people widely accept as ethical, or unethical. The reason I didn't want to get into this is as far as terminology use goes, is because there *are* differing views. This whole subject when discussing the differences between ethics and morality is often subjective altogether, and can be extremely ambiguous when you're talking about certain things.  
  
Getting back to the original  point I was trying to make...Could I have worded this and the OP to make that differentiation more clear? Sure, I probably could have...Hell, I could've included another example, or added in a question so it would seem more relevant so someone wouldn't feel the need to get into semantics and try to pick it apart as far as what is, and isn't the proper usage of ""morality"", and ""ethics""  
  
I just didn't feel like it was necessary. I felt like it was understood/implied. Intelligence isn't always knowing the difference between things, it can also be knowing whether or not something matters enough to bring it up. After all, this is /r/opiates , not /r/philosophy. You know what I mean?
  
Anyway, even though I wasn't particularly thrilled to go down this road, thank you for being willing to have a discussion about it without being some jerk that resorts to slinging poo. I hope I've explained the point I'm trying to make in a way that is satisfactory to you.

"I'm surprised that no one has mentioned this yet but, I would highly recommend two things that will most likely lessen, or completely rid you of your negative side effects, first, you should take a normal dose of benadryl about 30 minutes prior to taking your first dose of oxycodone. This will get rid of all, if not the majority of the itchiness that you're suffering from. Second, make sure that you are taking your dose on a full stomach. Something like a sandwich, or possibly toast, a bagel, etc. You want to use something that will fill your stomach and also won't add to any nausea that you're getting. By eating something filling, this will most likely limit or remove any nausea that you're suffering from. By doing these two things, I'm fairly certain that your experience with your pain medication will greatly improve. Try doing these things and let me know how it goes!

"&gt;Daily use for more than a couple weeks WILL cause physical dependence. It's just how brain chemistry works, especially with high order narcotics.

Are you a doctor? Do you have any sources for this? Because the many sources I have contradict that statement. You may have to increase your dose after a few months because of tolerance developing, but that doesn't inherently mean you are physically dependent on that drug outside of needing to take it for your pain. You don't have to believe me, but, again, I have taken opiates daily for months and stopped when what I was taking them for got better and had zero withdrawal whatsoever, several times over. The same for my pain patient friends. Just because you take an opiate for more than two weeks every day DOES NOT MEAN you will automatically become physically dependent. It's absolutely NOT how ""brain chemistry works."" And physical dependence doesn't mean addiction either.

&gt;See the hypocrisy there? You've never even seen addiction, but you're an expert?

There's no hypocrisy. I never said I was a doctor, nor an expert, but just because you are an addict or used to be one doesn't make you an expert either. I have seen addiction, but to other drugs like meth and coke. I work with a coke addict now. I dated one. I worked for one. I got beaten up by one in the middle of the floor at work in front of customers. I know how it works and how it destroys lives. I was speaking to the prevalence of opiate addiction in the general population from the perspective of a regular person who knows people who take opiates for pain but has never been surrounded by addicts. I think when you are surrounded by addicts, you think everyone is one. But the numbers just don't bear that out. You don't need to be living with addicts to read long term studies by reputable institutions by experts who know far more than any of us on thousands of legal and illicit opiate users over several years' time that show that very few of them become addicts. Your ""point"" or accusation here simply makes no sense at all.

No I'm not an expert, but I seem to have done a little more research on the topic than most people in this thread. It's a subject that's personal to me since addicts are the ones making it so difficult for me to get the pain medication I really need. I usually know more about my meds than the doctors prescribing it, as they have told me. I've been on a lot of different things so I educated myself. More people should do the same.",cohzpzz,opiates,1423646073,nSquib,1,0
"Dnm dope comes from the same place dope on the street comes from. It just so happens street dope usually goes through more people before it makes it way to the user making it a lot more cut. But if you find phone dealers in real life then you can get potent dope that's just as good as the dnm stuff. The stuff I'm getting currently from my dealer is a lot more potent than the dnm stuff I've tried. But yeah dnm is on average pretty potent. But it's also insanely expensive.

But yea if tolerance wasn't a think i think opiates would be a godsend, but it is and they just simply stop working eventually.

One day at the gym i was benching 225 and i dislocated my ac joint. I was going down with the weight and my shoulder started cracking and popping and shit, but i wasn't about to let it crush me so i pushed up and finished the rep. I went to the doc and he said to take motrin and stretch. I could not get dressed it hurt so horribly, i had to bite my tongue and put my shirt on with minimal movement. So i went back and he moved me up to naproxen, omfg this guy. He said ""i'm certainly not going to precribed narcotics ror this"" so i got up and left when he started writing the script for naproxen that i alrready had four bottles of at home from previous injuries. I went home, bought h for the first time (i've only done 20mg of percocet a month before for fun) and slammed it. Stupid, i know. I just wanted the pain to go away. So i blackd out after shooting a test shot, i don't remember anything after thqt. My parents found me 14 hours later, sprawled out on my bed with piss and shit and blood from my head. I was in the icu in a medically induced coma in critical condition, they had me intubated and on an ice pad to lower my temp, in a ward with other kids.

"*One* of my overdoses (I have OD'd a couple of times, fucked up. I know.) began with me doing a shot in my bathroom, walking in my room and boom, came to with my mom crying and paramedics and police officers in my room. 

as I start regain consciousness they get me up and out the door into the ambulance... While I'm laying in there an officer starts hounding me asking me where the rest of the drugs are and the spoon I used to cook it in.. So in response to his attitude I get one of my own and tell him there isn't any more drugs, why do you think I fell out? And as for the spoon, you watch too many movies officer.. You don't always have to cook heroin, I just put mine in the back cap of the syringe with water, crush it and filter it. Look in the cap and you'll see... 

After he did just that he still bitches at me, saying that if I'm lying and they find more drugs he will charge me with possession, paraphernalia, and lying to an officer of the law. After I basically told him to go suck one and we headed to the ER, I remembered that I indeed had more heroin... And had the bag in my hand when I fell out... So the whole time I'm at the hospital I'm worried as shit that they had to of found it. But apparently not.. I was released from the hospital a few hours later.. 

So when I get back to my room I panic and search like crazy... Couldn't find shit... So I gave up just knowing the police were gonna be back to arrest my dumb ass... Then I noticed the pile of vomit on the floor and started cleaning it... And guess the Fuck what... In the midst of me overdosing and puking in my room I dropped the well sealed baggie of dope and barfed all over that shit... Fucking crazy.. 

So the next morning I did what any self respecting junkie would of done, grabbed my hidden rig and banged that shit!! Haha. Sorry for the rambling I am ~~high~~ FUCKED UP. Haha.. 


**TL;DR: overdosed and dropped bag of dope then proceeded to puke on it. Cops didn't find it so no charges for me. Next morning wake up and bang the H I discovered hidden under my vomit**

"Ugh, long story,  what an awful memory. This was at the height of my first heroin addiction, as things were quickly going from manageable to totally fucked.  

I won a 5 or 6 day trip to cancun through work for being one of the top reps in my company. I bought 3 or 4 bundles for the trip. 

By the time I drove 4 hours to Charlotte, NC to catch the flight,  spent the night in a hotel and then delayed my departure because I was terrified to leave and terrified to fly with dope I did more dope than I should have.  I really wanted to play hookie and just skip the trip, but I knew that would not be good for my future at the company. So stupid... heroin addict worrying about my standing at work... if i only knew how fucked things really were I would have just skipped the trip. 

I knew I didn't have enough dope because of my 10-20 bag per day habit. This whole trip, pre-flight I was doing way more dope than I should have, just because I had no clue how to manage the situation. By the time I leave I have like a bundle and a half left. I put some in my car,  parked at the airport, for when I got back from Mexico and I tool the rest with me on the trip. I also had a bottle of 40 or so 50mg(I think) Tramadol . 

So I finally get to mexico. I go to the pharmacy and buy needles(scared to fly with those, for some reason). The rigs there were strange and when I made my first Shot I realized they had some kind of strange reservoir that made it so I couldnt get a fairly sizable amount of the liquid into my vein... It just like stayed in this little tip thing that the plunger didn't totally clear. So I'm wasting dope on each shot. 

I realize that my dope isn't going to last more than say 1 or 2 days at this point. I start my mission to find more. I am approached by one of the jillion rip off cab drivers asking me if I want coke, x, or weed. I'm pretty pumped now, because I figure if this guy has all that shit,  then he can probably score me some dope. Of course he tells me he can. 

So we set off on a mission to score dope. I've probably got $800 to $1000 for the trip and I figure I am in Mexico so that will obviously last me forever... WRONG... cancun is a rip off city and shit is not cheap there. They are adept at scamming tourists so its not like the rest of the country. 

We are driving all over the city. We get far from the nice resorts and into the proper slum ridden bowels of cancun. The driver picks up his cousin who has the largest piece of Cocaine I've ever seen in my life. He breaks off a piece and offers it to me and i figure it's best not to turn it down, even though a stimulant is the last thing I want right now. I do a fat line and it is very very good. I am tweaked now and scared. There are cops in trucks with like automatic rifles. I think I am destined for jail or to be kidnapped. They proceed to stop everywhere they can think of... pharmacies, people's houses etc... finally we find some pharmacist who says he has morphine. I buy it for $80 ad it's  these weird vials that are filled with an injectable liquid. It turns out it was really really low dose buprenorphin,  which i knew nothing about at the time. 

I run out of dope, start taking Tramadol which isn't doing jack shit for my wd's.  I try the vials of mystery liquid and of course they don't do anything but make my situation worse. 

I ditch that cabbie, who I paid lavishly for taking me on an unsuccessful mission, but won't leave me alone the rest of the trip hoping I will pay him more money. I find another pharmacy that supposedly has percocet. I buy some and it doesn't do shit.  I'm sure the concoction my stupid ass has put in my blood stream is just making things worse. 

So basically I spwnd the entire remainder of the trip in my room,   hating myself and counting down the time til my plane departs.  The time finally comes to leave and I have an awful uncomfortable dope sick flight home. I get to my car and shoot up right there in the airport parking lot.  Then I drive home and try to forget that shit. The entire time I was there,  I never set foot on the beach or went to a club or enjoyed myself one bit.

"Well I think many many junkies have the intention to care for others and are genuinely good people- but the problem is when push comes to shove and its getting a fix vs being a good person towards someone else, the fix usually wins. 

I think one thing that has been removed (for the most part) from this particular forum of junkie interaction that exists on the street is the whole money/dope/dope over people prioritization thing. You can't steal/rob, short, or shut someone out of your life because you think dope is more important here. 

For instance, I know in my life I've cut off a lot of people who genuinely care about me and want better for me because they weren't conducive to me getting high. Here- it's a virtual world so good nature is visible as it is detached from the hard reality junkies so often live.

"I just wanted to chime in here, I really enjoyed reading yalls discussion. As someone who has put together 3-15 months at a time over the past 9 years, I must say- while doing an IOP/AA combo, it was the shortest, 3 months (well obviously there's tons of times where I would go for 5-10 days for different shit and shit, but this is the shortest amount of time when *trying*)

The reason that I think I literally couldn't deal with it? It reminded of all the horrible controlling aspects that organized religion has had on my life. This program was on the west coast, but I grew up in the Deep South. That was the first time I ever found myself around zealots again. It worked for like 6 weeks pretty well. I was able to psych myself up enough for it to wanna do well and wanna be able to brag about my days (another thing that's really quite unhealthy for me). But then I started noticing the cult, the religion inside. It was people preaching to the choir. It was black and white, it was either pass or fail (de facto). By the third month, I had pretty much gone insane and quit the program entirely because I was starting to feel literally brainwashed. It was creepy and I did not like it.

Now, this is my only consistent/regular AA/NA experience so obviously this is just my one experience. But, I can see why it's being pointed out that it's basically a religion of itself. Im haf rn but if you want to talk about it more in depth feel free to hit me back. It's such an amazingly large part of our culture, and truly does help SO many people. But for some people like myself, I don't do really anything that's one-size-fits-all, and the 12-step programs are so fucking rigid (not hard, just not flexible - and that's de facto as well). I think a national dialogue about better ways to treat people who need help in a more personally-tailored way is very important .

At 8 I was ok but more depressed, apathetic, and lethargic. And I had a whole lot more to be happy about in my life back then than I do now. 

Reason I always heard was that bupe acts as a full agonist (like morphine, heroin, ect) at doses under 2mgs, but anything higher and it overwhelms the opiate receptors making it only a partial-agonist.

If you are gonna be hanging with other people (i am fairly confident you will be ok but safety is always an absolute must), then you can try taking half the number of Vic 10s you normally start with, and then administer 1mL rectally. Wait 40 mins to be safe and see how you feel with the vics kicking in and all, and then either administer the rest of what you have of the fent and eat another Vic, or do one or the other. Take it slow and be cautious. I also wouldn't recommend eating the somas and trams before this. I would wait til after to see how this new combo affects you. Fent is potent, but you have a weak dose of it for someone who is not opiate naive, and it will only weakened by your ROA because it's intended for IV. Rectally would be second best.

"I'm aware Lope is an opioid, and that's why it is used to treat diarrhea and can cause constipation, I should note when I said 200mg I was talking about Oxymorphone, not lope, though I do usually take like 25mg of lope when in w/d, and when I take it when not in w/d I still take a higher dose(I have something wrong with my abdomen that whenever I eat I just immediately have diarrhea, almost as soon as I swallow my food or finish a meal, they're not exactly sure why but think it's related to a genetic disease I have but it'd be a pretty unique manifestation of said disease). No idea what else you think it can be used for medically other than various forms of diarrhea(the only exception I can think of is when it's used by people with an ostomy and they're producing too much waste for their bag).  


I also was careful to say that it doesn't plug me up for more than 24-48hrs, meaning it does plug me up, but after ~2 days of Lope induced constipation that isn't seeming to let up, I use medical interventions to get things flowing again. I'm totally aware it is an opioid.

"I am also quite a pessimist. Or was a nihilistic hedonist. When I was 15. Maybe I still am, maybe we all are out here. But I gotta say, the one thing that has really blown my mind is travel. I see you also like to travel. I spent a year in S.E. Asia and I agree, the monks are not all made equal and the things I have seen some Cambodian monks do and heard of Thai monks doing is un-monklike. But, since you have been traveling, wouldn't you say that the world is a beautiful place overall? Sure, meditation can be escape, binge watching TV is escape and reading and dope are escapes. But travel broadens your horizons. You try new foods, meet new people, hear new points of view and have new experiences. 

Travel makes the world seem smaller (and bigger). It changes perspective. Maybe you need another vacation if you feel like life sucks down to the core. Maybe go somewhere more light-hearted, make some local friends who you can barely communicate with, and see the joy that is there in sharing your soda-water six pack with new friends and the ritual of drinking coffee and smoking hand rolled ciggs. Watch people smile at you. etc.  Whenever I feel that way I know what I need to do, and that is, ESCAPE, and widen my horizons even to watch them shrink as I return back to where I came. William Burroughs said that thoughts are a disease of the mind and I tend to agree with him. You guys all think way too much, myself included. The less you think about stuff that is unnecessarily, the happier you are. Also, the I-ching is pretty sweet.

Buying drugs is extremely safe when compared to selling. The tide of the western view of drugs is that it's a mental illness, and users almost exclusively go to jail by their own direct actions. I know of not a single user who was set up, nor a user who went to jail while purchasing drugs.

"Lol no need to distinguish your God my friend, im glad for his help :) and Ya I've been through this once before. Last spring I came home for the break in between winter and summer semester and stayed with my parents for almost 3 weeks to hopefully get help for my ankle, as I'd just hurt it once again. My parents have a friend at the same place I've been going, and were able to get me into an appt with hi. But he's an orthopedic surgeon specializing in shoulders. He xrayed my ankle, no MRI or other imagining, prescribed me mobic (FUCK. THAT), and I had to go to PT 3 days/week. Imma be doing 5 days/week at first just so that the staff can monitor my healing progress, and then after 2-3 weeks drop down to 3 days/week. As this is my right/driving ankle, my parents will be driving me. So luckily I will have no choice to miss them :) anyway, I went to HS with one of the head therapists and we were always good friends, so it's fun to go in and get to talk to her too!

"I've always considered a standard dose of APAP (i.e. around 500mg) to be reasonably close, in terms of damage to your liver, to one alcoholic drink. I'm not a doctor, I have no idea whether or not that's accurate, but it's always served as a good guideline for me whenever I've had mixed opiates like Norcos or Percs. I figure if I want to take 8 pills it'd be about the same as having 8 shots, and anything more of either could potentially destroy my liver in about the same way. In your case, you might consider yourself to have taken about 4 shots a day for the last 6 years. Not sure if that helps you figure out the amount of damage done, but I would guess it's a lot easier to find information about liver damage due to drinking alcohol than it is to find out about it as a result of APAP usage. I haven't had more than one or two beers in about 5 years, and before that I got drunk very infrequently, so my liver is possibly a bit healthier than most people, which would give me a slightly higher threshold for damage from Tylenol. If you're a heavy drinker, and have been for a while then you should probably be more careful with high, regular doses of APAP. If you're worried about damaging your liver you could always learn to perform a CWE - Cold Water Extraction. It's a reasonably simple and effective method of separating the Hydrocodone from the Tylenol.",cocm1j2,opiates,1423184765,Reichsprasident,1,0

"LOADS of conspiracy shit about her killing him out there. IMO, she did it or hired someone to kill him. 
Her dad even says she probably did, there's this documentary about it and he reads a poem she wrote where she says when she gets older she will marry people, use them for their money and kill them. She was pissed at Kurt for turning down lollapalooza where nirvana would've made like 3 million, alot of money for many different people, also he was divorcing her and shit. 

She hired a private investigator to find him after he left rehab, and I forget the specifics but I believe the nanny claimed she saw him and he was going to their Washington house. Anyway, Courtney called the electrician that found his body and told him just to check up on their Washington home to make sure everything was working. She wasn't planning on going there anytime soon, I believe she was on tour.

His friends say that when he was in rehab before this happened he was doing fucking great. He was happy, he made plans to go fishing with his grandfather when he got out of rehab.

Oh and the shotgun was placed on his chest. Which would be impossible after you just blew your entire face off with it, you'd drop it or something more likely. Also it's probably fairly hard to point a shotgun at yourself and pull the trigger.

But perhaps most convincing in the documentary was that some guy came forward saying Courtney approached him and offered 50k to kill Kurt, then he interviewed and died under really suspicious circumstances the next day or two.",coonsg6,opiates,1424216850,judgefudge707,4,0

"Wellbutrin is really strange and unique compared to other anti-depressants because it acts on dopamine and adrenaline instead of serotonin. For me, I went through ""phases"" with this drug, some good and some bad, but once I finally got used to it I decided I really liked it-- to me it's almost like being on adderall all day. At first it made me extremely anxious, and if you can, I recommend getting something to take with it to help the anxiety (benzos obviously work wonders but if you can find something less life-ruining, more power to you!). I remember 1) not feeling any effects from the drug until like 6 weeks of using it. Then one day it hit me like a ton of bricks... Heart racing, euphoria, erections every 4 seconds like I was 12 again- my body was going fucking nuts till I told the doc I needed a lower dose. After that, it had this really bad social anxiety effect on me where I felt like my mouth was sealed shut and I barely talked to anyone during that period. After a couple weeks I got used to it though, and now it finally just does its job- gives me the boost and motivation to get through a miserable day at work. Oh, and I have been using the whole time and don't see any negative effects of the wellbutrin on my oxy (but be careful if you for some reason like tramadol; Tapentadol is actually not too bad in my opinion but you have to be careful with that one too since those opioids also work on adrenaline and its a good way to have a seizure).

"I've never heard of Smart recovery before.. sounds interesting. I disagree with the 12 steps and a lot of AA/NA but I still do think that going to the meetings is helpful even if it's just for moral support and finding people to relate to. There are some meetings that are very lax on the religious/12 step aspect of the program and instead simply focus on the overall well being and mental state of recovering addicts.

But yeah I simply can't do the 12 steps. I understand how having/believing in a higher power can really benefit you but I've lived my entire life firmly believing in the exact opposite, that there is no higher power. Just because I'm in recovery doesn't mean that I'm willing to just straight up go against what I've believed and felt strongly about for my entire life. It's too forceful and feels very church like/cult-like in my opinion to just straight up tell everybody that they now have to start believing in God or some type of higher power all of a sudden or they won't succeed in recovery. 

On one hand, AA emphasizes how they are accepting of everybody yet you're still expected to pray to god after every meeting as if it was something that everybody is expected to be OK with and willing to be apart of. ",cod6ah3,opiates,1423240522,JimLahey330,2,0

"As I've grown older my views on the reality of existence have drastically changed. From staunch atheist to agnostic to ... well, not even sure anymore. I now truly feel that we are not bodies with a soul, but souls with a body. As spiritual beings who incarnate upon this earth for certain experiences we wish to partake in... There is scientific proof of [reincarnation](http://www.amazon.com/Journey-Souls-Studies-Between-Lives-ebook/dp/B001MTENOC/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1424800809&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=soul+reincarnation)  and Vedanta and Buddhist teachings both profess the immortality of the soul. Which happens to fit quite nicely with a certain saying in physics.  I mention these schools of thought because they are not faith-driven, they are experience driven.

Now, when you get to the quantum level (subatomic particles) - all the ""rules"" of physical law break down. Two particles can be in two places at the same time (co-location). Or they may be separated by vast lengths but both what is done to the one will be exhibited *instantaneously* in the other, no matter the distance (think on that one... that is *faster than light* communication.) A particle can be a particle, *and* a wave at the same time. (Dual-slit experiment). Freaky shit eh?

But wait.. don't scientists have it all figured out? They certainly act like they do.

Fuck no.

Scientists make shit up as they go along all the time. They alter equations, they ""make shit fit"" to tie up the loose ends to our current physical model. 

A physical model which can identify 4.9% out of all known matter, the other ~95% is dark energy and dark matter.

In layman's terms, scientists can only really say for SURE what 5 PERCENT of all the shit in the universe is... plus, it fucking rains diamonds on Uranus into oceans of liquid diamond, with diamond-bergs floating around. The universe is much stranger than we think. 

Science has become a sort of religion nowadays, with its own self-serving hierarchy, dogmatic belief system and fierce condemnation of anything that doesn't fit the norm. Check out ""The Science Delusion"" by Rupert Sheldrake.

So what am I getting at? 

The Buddhists and Vedantists believe in rebirth of the soul, continuously, until the great release - until you 'figure out its all a game' and find your way back to the source. Your spiritual mission here in life can be severely restricted by drugs. In fact, a mental addiction to any object on the material plane can hamper one's spiritual growth. 

It goes without saying that the negative reperecussive effects of drug withdrawal, the lifestyle of bad choices, etc. etc. do not really fit well with the whole ""enlightened"" mindset... without getting deeper into it, heroin addiction is not conducive to a spiritual lifestyle. Are you taking care of the proverbial temple that houses the soul? Or are there punctures all over it, waste matter backed up for days, and junk food running the complex?

Ironically, the Heroin high offers a *very* similar experience to what one achieves during/after states of prolonged meditation - a tranquility unmatched. However, with the dope, there's a price to pay for taking the shortcut.

Beware fellow travelers. Our time here is limited. Drugs are just a tool, a dangerous one at times, but they are not a path to enlightenment.

"Went to the islands of Spain to teach abroad this past September. I was supposed to be there from sept - June teaching English and living an awesome life in the Balearic Islands. I fucked up so hard and came off a daily g habit of pretty much a few years. 

It was the worst detox of my life. I got kicked out of my initial sleeping arrangements after the first night because I basically fucked up the bathroom and bedroom. I was under the impression I would have my own apartment so it sucked when I found out that I was sharing this flat with 4 other people. I knew it would suck, but not nearly as and as it did.

After I was kicked out after the first night, I went to a nearby hotel and tried to gather myself. It sucked, and I was quickly reminded why I got down in the first place. I have severe spinal stenosis and back pain arose with a vengeance on my 2nd day. No amount of sub helped.


I bounced from the island after 5 days because I was hurting so bad.The whole ordeal ended up costing me almost two grand. One of my biggest regrets is leaving. I really feel I fucked up a cool opportunity in a cool place.",coh80mh,opiates,1423591427,slayliketwoods,2,0

"Maybe because reality really blows? I mean I'm a pessimist I guess, but in my experience it just seems that life really fucking sucks when you get to the bottom of it. Everyone has something they do to escape reality. Even the monks that bring themselves through meditation to be completely ""in the moment"" and in reality are practicing a form of escape and I've seen plenty of these monks do funny things when they think everyone's back is turned (On my trips to Japan). I don't think reality will ever be good because maybe reality is the problem. We've evolved too highly and think too much and want too much, etc. **The Conspiracy Against the Human Race** is a really good book on the subject, with the other even going so far as to say the only way to escape struggle is for the human race to stop breeding. Kind of extreme but it does seem true.

"Yeah I feel a lot like you. I think one of the biggest problems with mental illness is not only spotting it, but people hide it or don't think they have a mental illness. I didn't start getting treated for depression until someone found me almost dead passed out from pills. Suddenly everyone around me was like ""Shit, how could that kid have depression?"" And I didn't even think I had depression, I just felt bored and fed up with life and alone, but I thought that was how life was supposed to be. When I got into treatment tho, I started to hide shit more because I was embarrassed/I didn't want to stop. I even lied to my own therapist about using when it didn't matter at all. *How do you treat people who would rather lie and keep suffering than be healthy?*

I've done some 12 step stuff, I've done meditation, I've had therapy, I've been on 2 antidepressants, I've been 10+ mood supplements. I've self-medicated a whole lot of course.

"Don't burn! I keep everything I've ever written (which is..... A lot haha). Sometimes I'll go 2-3 years without looking at certain notebooks from different times. But, no matter what, I always feel it's a benefit to be able to look back and see what/how my brain was thinking/not thinking at that point in time. Very fascinating

It can also be a symbolic kinda thing. Like 2011 involves emotions that I still haven't been able to revisit, more loss/devastation/death in one half hour than most people see in their entire lives. Probably won't be able to revisit it until years from now. But I know that at some point, I'll want to see what my brain was doing *in the moment* because now all i have are interpretations of memories from 4 years ago, and that's not really accurate

It also feels good to know that I can consciously keep that journal buried at the bottom of the stack and not have to touch it until im ready- kinda helps me continue repressing shit when I need to. Not that I think repression is healthy, but tbh if I didn't repress 90% of what was going on at the time, I'd have killed myself. If I didn't continue to repress certain things (aka survivors guilt manly, as well as mental images of the deceased) then I wouldn't be able to carry on day-to-day. But im eventually gonna get to a point where I'm gonna need to address this shit as opposed to repressing it, and I think journals are Going to be invaluable for that

I don't think this has anything to do with the drugs themselves.

So it's not heroin that ruins them, it's just that once they're already hooked heroin is the more sensible option. When people can control their use, they will likely stick to pharms, because they don't carry the heavy stigma of heroin.

I highly disagree with your prior sentiment (in your previous article) that addicts need jail time to get to a better place/ “clean”, one size doesn’t fit all and just because some addicts get clean because of jail/prison doesn’t mean all will and most will end up having a lot of free time to shoot up due to their new criminal record and thus probable lack of gainful employment.

"Heroin used to be used medically which im sure you know. It was the new less addictive than morphine but stronger wonder drug. I'm not sure what exactly prompted the stop. I think because they found it to be more addictive. Which imo is bs all opiates are the same as far as addictiveness goes. Sorry I didn't mean to offend you. I wasn't making fun of you because you did say you weren't hip to the drug culture. Which is fine it doesn't make one cooler or less cool that's for sure. I totally get your point about opiates being a monster or dragon being more descriptive for sure. I just had never heard it as a catch all. Always specifically in reference to smoking. Never even heard it used about injecting. Maybe its a regional thing. Out here its not even part of the lingo. I always assumed it was like a 60s or 70s thing I'd very rarely here mentioned.Edit: As far as the coke oxy coctail. Those work damn good. Its a fairly common method. I didn't see anywhere in the comments here or post that mentioned your routine or even specifics of drug in relation to dose. Maybe you meant you've mentioned it in another post altogether though.

Do you hold a clean dry cotton ball or a clean piece of dry toilet paper firmly over the injection site after removing the needle? This should be done every time you remove the needle for about one minute to help prevent bruising. If the needle size is larger than what you're used to using that can cause bruising too because a larger gauge needle causes a bigger hole which causes more blood to escape the vein.

I'm glad I did because I actually learned quite a bit from your reply. Thank you! I guess what I meant by my comment is I think its funny when people freak out about someone mentioning they took more than the recommended dose on the packaging. Like you mentioned it only acts on the areas you specified, unlike other opiates which act on that area as well in addition to everything else they affect. I'm having trouble articulating my point, probably because im high and super tired and just took a bunch of tests for school so my brain is kind of mush. I think what im trying to say is that lope is unique in that it only affects the digestive tract, like all opiates. Taking any opiate will plug a person up and it isn't more dangerous than say hydrocodone or oxycodone as far as intenstinal health. People sometimes post things like the bottle says take 2 but I took 6.

Morals are things that would apply regardless of variable circumstances. You feeling bad because you were lied to by an addict....its because you DO have morals and feel guilt due to betraying your moral code at the behest of a skilled liar. Ethics in the drug/dealing game would be more like.... 'Do I not pay my supplier because my kids are out of food at home?' or maybe 'Should I lie to my wife about my drug habit to save her the worry?' Morals factor in, but ethics are usually slightly benevolent underneath it all.",corr3it,opiates,1424460193,memorelapse,2,0

And tbh, im realllllllly glad the northeastern style of dope slinging (stamps/buns) has not caught on in the south yet! I am very very very precise when it comes to dosing- I like to know exactly how much of something im putting in my body. Obviously with a new connect there's always some uncertainty at first, but once they realize that they won't be getting my return business if they're giving me 0.88 and calling it a gram, things usually straighten up pretty quick lol. Like the half g I got this afternoon was exactly 0.5 (I mean it's from one of my best friends so I wouldn't expect to get ripped off, but if *he* had gotten sold 0.9 as a g then we woulda split the rip and had 0.45 each instead of 0.5 each

"Lab results came back today. My UA sample had 225ng/ml of oxycodone present. This is barely, barely detectable considering the threshold is 100ng/ml. I literally had 225 millionths of 1 mg present. 

This supports the case that my contact with oxycodone was not only negligible but easily incidental. These are the exact words of my court appointed case manager. 

It is true that the court system is full of fiends and drug addicts who come up with bs stories all day long in an effort to deny or camouflage abusing drugs. Unfortunately, in my instance, this makes it much harder to show that I was not misusing a prescribed medication. 

These UA tests are objective in that they very reliably detect the presence of various illicit and prescription medications. A positive result very objectively shows that the substance was present, no more. It is then up to humans to determine if this positive test indicates anything from drug abuse, taking medications as prescribed to accidental ingestion. Fortunately, the lab result of 225ng/ml supports the accidental ingestion determination. 

Other factors such as the fact that I have never had an addiction to opiates(I am an alcoholic in recovery), I have always been honest about use of drugs *before* drug tests (positive for THC on two occasions in the past) and the solid relationships that I have with my PO, case manager and therapist. These factors will absolutely help tilt the final determination by the judge in favor of the truth although this is an admittedly rare and difficult to initially believe circumstance. 

I am without a doubt a complete moron for storing my medications in the way that I did. I do not deny this. I am not, however, dishonest or misusing oxycodon.  ",cow1737,opiates,1424816734,One-Erection,0,0

"This is how the progression of pain meds went for me with my current doctor.

Tramadol + Cyclobenzoprine (Muscle Relaxer) is what he started me out on.  Then it went like this:    
Percocet 5/325 &gt; Percocet 10/325 &gt; Percocet 10/325 + Oxycodone IR 10mg &gt; Percocet 10/325 + Oxycodone IR 15mg &gt; Oxycodone IR 15mg + Fentanyl 25mcg/hr &gt; Oxy IR 15mg + Fentanyl 50mcg/hr &gt; Oxy IR 15mg + Fentanyl 75mcg/hr

And it was at this point that he decided that the dosages and amounts were too large for his comfort as a primary care physician and referred me to pain management.  And I'm currently on MSContin ER 60mg twice a day + MSContin ER 30mg once a day + Oxycodone IR 15mg 4 times a day.

Oh yeah, he continues to write me the Tramadol prescription as I tell him that I don't like taking the narcotic pain killers while I'm trying to drive.  And something else that I got away with for a while was while I was getting the Fentanyl Patches and Oxycodone IR 15mg, I would also call in the Percocet 10/325mg and it would be written and given to me with no questions asked.  I was hitting myself when I asked for a larger dosage of Fentanyl that sent me to the Pain Management.  Haha.  Not to mention that PM is a co-pay every month whereas he never charged me for scripts.

I was constantly tired and lethargic when I was on 8mgs and it didn't make me feel good.  Once I got on 2mgs and stabilized, I felt much better in every aspect.  Some days I would even catch a nice little buzz from it.  I believe it is due to the fact that at lower doses you are getting norbupenorphine to your receptors.

Just drink a few extra glasses of water and pee three or four times leading up to your UA. If you are worried, you can do the dilution method. Ill give ya my story: Its all from experience, but can't guarantee it will work for you.

People always warned about dilution and it causing you to fail a UA for altering the test. Never heard of it actually happening. But i have passed 8 months of 2 UAs a week. I was dirty for over half of those. Every test day I would drink a gallon+ of water 3-4 hours before my UA. Take a bunch of vitamin b, 2 or 3 when you start drinking you water, and then 1 every hour or so before the test. I never failed a single UA. I honestly don't think the cheap UAs that they use at jails, and probation offices test for dilution. 

Even if they say your sample looks diluted, or have a test saying its diluted, you should be able to just say you drank a bunch of water after you worked out, yadada, deny deny deny, and say it won't happen again.

#1. dress nice, don't look like a junkie. obviously don't wear an evening gown, just dress nice. casual like you're going to work or something.

#2. the doctor is the boss. do whatever they say. if he only gives you some 800mg ibuprofen take it home and when you go in for your next visit tell him it's not working. you could also try calling after a few days/week and saying it's not working.  hopefully you get started on at least some vic 5s.  and if you've tried to play the game and the doctor still won't give you what you want GET A DIFFERENT DOCTOR.  people get scared to do this because they think it's ""doctor shopping"" doctor shopping is when you have more than one doctor giving you meds and they don't know about each other. it is perfectly within your legal rights to shop around and find a doctor whom you like and who is willing to treat your pain.

#3 do not ever mention any drugs by name.  ever.  huge red flag.  the only exception is if the doctor asks you what works.  and even then i think it's best to play dumb.

"Lol I didnt smoke my meth I went straight to banging that shit. But i cant speak to the addictivness from personal experience. But the people I know most have had more sucess quiting meth than dope. Opiates will always have my heart but its becoming harder and harder. A few months ago picking up an 80 on friday and id have half of it left saturday. Now i get an 80 on friday and have a 20 shot left before I even get back home. Hours have been shit at work latley 20-24 hours a week. This week i think is the first 40 hour week ive had in probobly 4 months. My boss likes to give 32 maybe 36 hours a week tops. inflation happens every year but raises arent given in my company. Now I understand I work for a shit company and I seriously need to look at going to a trade school to learn something. Im just terrified of going to school for a trade. Getting a job in that trade and within 2-3 years hating my job and my trade but being stuck. I blame my dad. He started working on cars at 16. He dropped out of school and the only type of work he knows is being a mechanic but has been miserabley sick of it for 10-15 years now. But hes stuck. Im fearful thats going to be me. I dont know ive been thinking about trades a lot latley. Maybe a diesel mechanic. My dads a mechanic at a volvo dealership. He can work on anything u bring him but its mostly just gas cars and suv's he also hates that cars these days are all computers. He misses work on carbourated ( I know thats misspelled ) engines like the old days. At least diesel engines tend not to have small engine compartments that require unnatural bending and contorting to get to the back. and any company with any large vehicles ( from 1 ton pick ups to 365 cat excavators ) needs a mechanic so the job security is there. I wanted to be a heavy equipment operator and still do but you dont just get hired right off the streets to drive the front end loader. Its all about promotion so you have to be a laborer for 3-5 years before they will teach you even small equipment like bachoes and 305 excavators. I, having a very surgically repairded knee that is one minor knee injury away from a full knee replacment, am unsure I could handle being a labour. I would work my ass off but I am just scared that my knee wont hold up. I really need to stop letting fears run my life. Fear of the unknown, fear of what could go wrong, fear of hatting a job that im now stuck in. I let fear run my life. Well fear and dope. Dope runs my life, and fear prevents my from trying to achieve more than what I have now.",cobkmd0,opiates,1423101197,GanjaHeroX420,1,0

"I now have 4 big, regular clients now who pretty much provide me with like 3/4 of my  income pretty much. 1 is the guy who got me first started, I see him no more than once a month usually more like 1.5-2 months and I usually blow him but sometimes we just sit together and talk for a half hour to an hour. He did creep me out by saying he loves me though, that just happened. He thinks we have some sort of relationship but I honestly don't know his name. I think he told me once but I've been too embarrassed to ask since I've seen him off and on for like 4 years now. Not regularly either, there were like 2 years I saw him maybe once a year. But he doesn't know my phone number, doesn't know where I live, knows me by a fake first name, yet told me he loves me a couple months ago. He's so insanely lonely and unhappy in his marriage(Yea I know) that I feel bad for him. Sometimes I want to tell him he didn't need to give me so much money because he has some bad health problems and works an insane amount but then my greed kicks in and the times I did tell him I didn't need the normal amount he still gave it  to me, or close at least(300). I just feel bad because I see him for 30-60 minutes max and get 300 bucks when half the time I just get held by him. 

The second is someone who I see more like every 7 to 10 days and he is a bit unusual. He has this master slave fantasy but what he asks me to do is what's strange to me. Basically, he can only get off if he like lays belly down on this blanket and like uses his hand that's crammed underneath him as he also kind of humps the bed/blankets. I think it's something he did as a kid and now he has to get off like that. But all I do is lay next to him and respond to him while rubbing his back. He is obsessed with my chest and fantasizes about me never wearing a shirt and whipping my chest so basically he will go through this scenario and I kind of  play along. It's super awkward for me sometimes if he asks me to be at all creative because I'm really awkward and can't make up anything and I feel like I sound so stupid saying anything ""sexy"" because Im so obviously not into it. He is able to cum successfully maybe half the time and it takes about an hour of rubbing and going along with his story. He will commonly say, I'll let you earn an extra 20 or 40 if I do something like let him whip my chest after or go in the  car with a coat but no shirt underneath and I always say yes but he never does anything or asks me to follow through. In fact when I ask he says no but he still gives me the extra money. Only one time has he actually taken a belt and hit my chest insanely lightly and only like 2 times then stopped. I wouldn't mind letting him either if it meant I didn't have to talk as much lol. I barely say anything as it is and it's mostly just ""yes"", ""you  can whip my chest as much as you want"", I'll do whatever you say, etc. It's honestly funny how different he is normally and when he's getting into that. He is an old guy(like all my regulars) who seems super straight edge and normal and kind of a buzz Killington type but he has such a strange and specific fantasy/way of getting off. I see him every 10-15 days usually but the nice thing about him is i can hit him up and say hey man can I see you I'm in a bad spot right now and can count on seeing him within a day or two max nearly every time. For example, I texted him last night and he is meeting me in like 10 minutes. I saw him last on the superbowl. He gave me 120 last time but when I texted him yesterday I said things were bad and I'm pretty sure he is giving me extra. Probably 150-160.

Then there's the tickler, the guy who doesn't do anything that's remotely sexual in my eyes but he loves my feet and basically I go watch TV while he massages and occasionally tickles them. I see him 2-3 times a week and he's pretty insane and thinks we are best friends but it's such easy, consistent money I have to do it since I don't have to do anything I dislike. 

There's also a gay couple who love my feet as well and jerk off to them while smelling my feet, putting my dirty ass socks in their mouth etc. I wrote another comment about them in  more detail but gotta go meet Mr. Master slave guy now so peace. ",col9int,opiates,1423925800,Throwawaymhooker,1,0

As for the suboxone and methadone I don't see the point in switching to methadone because I get my script free because of a discount card my doctor gives me so all I pay is the $25 co-pay for my doctors visit.

 Now I should talk to my doctor about these problems I'm having. But in my mind the only outcome of that is him either giving me 16mgs a day instead of 8mgs which I've done before and it doesn't help that much more. Or he'll start tapering my off, which he's already talking about and he'll start regularly piss testing me.

 [**History of Jacksonville, Florida**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History%20of%20Jacksonville,%20Florida): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;The city of [Jacksonville, Florida](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida) began to grow in the late 18th century as __Cowford__, settled by British colonists. Its major development occurred in the late nineteenth century, when it became a winter vacation destination for tourists from the North and Midwest. Its development was halted or slowed by the [Great Fire of 1901](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Fire_of_1901), the [Florida Land Bust of the 1920s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Florida_land_boom_of_the_1920s), and the economic woes of the 1960s and 70s. Since the late 20th century, the city has experienced steady growth, with a new federal building constructed in downtown in 2003.

"Hmmmm I gotta disagree with justin on this one- I am also prescribed addy 20s (only 60/month tho) and 30x10mg Valium. It is an ***UNBELIEVABLY*** good cocktail for making it through withdrawals 

Combined with the lope, you should be good to go tbh. You'll def still have shitty times, and the Valium may not even be enough to knock you out the first few nights so be prepared for a bit of an addy binge/paranoia session possibly lol. But when I quit using this script, I usually do something as follows-

40+mg of addy immediately upon waking, or 6am if I didn't sleep at all. Then after breakfast time like around 10 maybe, another 20-30mg depending on how much energy you feel you need to compensate for

Around 2-3 in the afternoon when the oxy cravings really start hitting you, take 5mg of the Valium and possibly 10mg more of addy

At night time get a big milkshake or ice cream sundae or something and wind down, and put down 2-3 Valium. The key here, like I mentioned earlier, is that there may not be an amount of Valium high enough to get you to sleep, so *dont overdo it.* If you can't sleep, just aim to be as relaxed as possible in bed with your eyes shut- pretending to sleep can help almost as much as real sleep sometimes. Over the next few days, taper down the amount of addy you're taking because your brain will start readjusting to a no-opiate zone

Now, the tough part is after the first week, when the ""worst"" is over. The Valium will need to be managed very well so that you can try and minimize your cravings as much as possible. 

Also, im not a doctor, take all of this advice with a grain of salt, specifically the dosage. Be smart, know your limits with each of the substances. And good luck dude!",coed70y,opiates,1423342668,Southern_psychonaut,8,0

"I'm a shit head but bupe misinfo makes me angry so I took the time to decipher what you're trying to say. I could be wrong. Here's your question as I see it. worded by someone who speaks english and didn't get hit in the head by a car.

Your asking if your bupe levels are stabilized at 8mgs a day, how long does it take until this urine level is down to a sixth of that? If you were to get high when you reached this lower metabolite level could you then have enough time to get back to the previous stabilized levels all within two weeks? 

The answer is yes you could if we assume the metabolism is linear. I didn't look into the variation between half life, metabolism and urine levels but I'm going to assume they all work on a similar scale. It would be pretty much right to the day as youd have to stop taking it for 6 days, get high and then take it for the following 7 days. Doing it that way would be crazy though because you'd be really sick before you got high. I often do dope less than 12 hours after taking 8mgs of suboxone. I have to do a lot and it's a waste but I can catch a nod by morning. So the assumption that one would wait for the urine levels to be that low is crazy.

today at work i snorted 5mgs and for sure felt more than last night. i don't like snorting usually cause the high is so short. 
on my way to a show tonight, i popped a whole 10mg orally and made my way to the venue. took a long while to hit me. thought it was just going to barely give me a buzz, it took so long. figured my tolerance was fucked. 

then it hit. oh shit, i was super hyper. talking with strangers and texting a lot of random friends on my phone, haha. it was fun, but yeah, i remember what you said about being annoying. i could see how i probably would have been a pain if i wasn't there alone. i would bug the shit out of someone i went with cause i would just babble haha!

"Its just not practical to do full time, the people who try end up broke petty-criminals with vengeful friends and family generally.

Not to mention its a logistical nightmare if you have to travel or otherwise not be able to dose up at normal intervals.

As far as depression and opiates, SO MANY people are convinced that opiates are 'the missing element' of their lives. Opiates are the answer bc when you take them all your problems are non-issues ... you just feel great so how could it be bad? 

What they don't initially realize is that EVERYONE gets that blissful contentment - its the main fucking side effect. When it wears off, your troubles are there-stronger from the rest you've given them.

Don't know what country you're in but in America, depression has become commercialized and monetized to the point where someone having a bad day now has a 'chemical imbalance' that needs to be medically corrected. People take all these physiological measures to fix a problem that should be corrected other ways. They fuck with their brain chemistry trying to find the right course of treatment when really....

Depression exists in 99 out of 100 cases because you have a shifty life. Medicine doesn't fix a shifty life, proactive measures to better your environment do. Go to school, work towards a better job, get in shape, be social, try to trick some poor girl into thinking you're datable, MOVE SOMEWHERE NEW and surround yourself with interesting new people, ect... Trouble is - all that is very hard. People are lazy for the most part. Opiates are quick and initially pretty affordable, so the choice is easy.

Of course you can quit ya dolt. What makes you so special that your problems are worse than anyone elses? You think devolving into a drug problem will 'handle' that depression? C'mon man you're smarter than that.

Quit just to prove to yourself that you can, work towards what makes you happy in life (not drug related - that should enhance the stuff you already have, not be the foundation itself)  

It doesn't mean you're quitting for life, 99% chance that is impossible anyway. That's not a problem though if you recognize drugs for what they are.",co81wgq,opiates,1422826065,Rx_Love,13,0

Back then I was doing 2 80s a day and was getting paid every Monday at 2 AM.

After that there are flashes of crushing more than one 80, someone getting pulled over and me talking the cops into letting me drive them home.

"Wait, so you've been clean for 2 and a half months and you're going to start sub maintenance?

I ask because I'm on a clean streak again. I used to shoot multiple times daily, tapered off with illegally bought subs. Relapsed and never really went quite as deep as I was, more of a chipper, but slowly escalating. Went on a 3 week binge recently, and now I'm 6 days off the needle but using a lot of Kratom everyday. My question is this: I really feel like if I could get on a Suboxone program I could just stay clean for a long time, and eventually get off opiates completely. As it is right now, my physical addiction is pretty minor, but I have very little faith in my ability to stay clean and feel like at any day I'm just going to get back to shooting all the time. Would a suboxone clinic give me a script just so I can stay off the needle? Even if I'm not deep in it right now?

I go to NA but honestly those meeting make me want to cop real bad. ",co7fm3g,opiates,1422765240,pokwok,4,0

"I have no idea how I'm going to enjoy being sober again either. Even before I started using I didn't really enjoy being sober lmao. However through my nights of being high off my ass and researching random shit I think I honestly have a better grip on things I can do to improve almost every aspect of my life. I'm focusing on improving those so my life gets better, slowly, while I'm off. Hopefully my retarded depressed ass will keep it up and think that it's just life returning to normal. Lol. 

I don't think I'll ever be able to quit forever. It's like finding a small piece of heaven on earth except if you stay too long it turns into hell. So I'm trying to just visit God on the weekends and learn to enjoy my time away from the dick bag too. 

I used to only use at night. Then, it was all well and good. Sure, I was an addict, but I didn't wake up craving and I didn't seem to have as many side effects. I got a new job working days meaning no more late nights and it's also construction so it meant much more back and knee pain. I started to stop taking them after work because I couldn't enjoy them. I'd start to feel like crap in the evening and just smoke some pot or pop a Xanax ( half a mg knocks me out, I hate the Xanax high lol) and I'd instead wake up a few hours before work, take some shit and be high as fuck watching anime and then high all morning usually. Honestly, I loved it. I wouldn't think about getting high again until late at night and it made my day go by a lot quicker. Well, it got to a point where the pain of work in the evening and my brain telling me I'm supposed to be high at night and it not liking my new decision. Instead of stopping the morning dose, I did what all good addicts do and popped a few at night too. I'm sure you can see where this is going. 

I legit hope you can get back to weekend use and enjoy life sober again man. It's almost funny how I feel a bond and want people I don't know to succeed just based on us all being fucking retarded lmao. But seriously, we say we don't know if we can be happy sober again but we know it's bullshit. We can. People have all over the world in worse situations than us (no offense, not trying to downplay your life, mine has sucked a bag of dicks for the most part). We can get sober. I'm lucky I have 2 amazing kids who keep Me fighting and a wonderful girlfriend all who I want to stop for. If you have no one you really want to stop for, then stop for yourself. Imagine having that same feeling you got when high as shit, but feeling it every weekend! Imagine all the extra money you'll have, being able to have an environment where after you get high you have what you want so you can play games or watch movies or fuck someone for hours etc. Sorry for rambling, I'm just in a mood lol. If you feel like talking more or anything shoot me a pm, also, if you do try to get back to weekend warrior status, check out /r/opiatewithdrawal. Cheers!

"And okay, I guess I will oblige you.

How did you got into opiates?
When I was 17, I had surgery on my nose to correct my deviated septum and was prescribed Vicodin. That's when the love affair began.

How would you describe effects of opiates to marijuana smoker?
Opiates make you feel like you are being wrapped in a warm, fuzzy blanket all over your body. Most of your cares and worries fade into a whisper the more the feeling seeps into you.

Do you use opiates on daily basis and if you do, how does it affect you?
Right now because of my legal problems, I can't use every day like I used to. This causes me to have intense cravings daily and drug dreams pretty frequently. For example, the other night I dreamed that I was smoking BTH (which is not my ROA or even the kind of heroin that I use), and last night I had a dream that I was scraping the coating off an Opana with a razor blade.

Have opiates left negative/positive effects on your life?
It's great for anti-anxiety/depression. Catching a case because of heroin, however, is not cool.

How heavy are withdrawal syndroms [sic] upon trying to quit?
I assume you mean symptoms...depending on the habit of the person prior to the withdrawals, it can range from mildly uncomfortable to near hell on earth.

If someone would say that he wants to try opiates, what would be your advice to him?
I would tell that person to learn as much as they can about what they are about to put into their body (which goes for every kind of drug, not just opiates). Read up on harm reduction techniques. Don't go crazy with your dosing...remember, you can always do more, but you can't do less once you fall out. Find some Narcan.

"Oh! A HCV question just popped into my head... My dad actually contracted HCV from a blood transfusion after getting hit by a car before I was born. Apparently this was before hospitals like knew about it and people could get HCV and HIV from donated blood in hospitals. But he found out he got HCV, and he had to do an Interferon treatment for a year (supposed to be 6 months, but it didn't work I guess so he had to do another 6 months). It worked; he no longer has HCV! But he said the treatment was absolutely god-awful. He had to like inject the medicine into his stomach like daily, and he felt like he had the flu all day. I don't think he was able to work either, and basically had to lay in bed all day while my Mom took care of him. 

But I've heard they came out with a new treatment (unsure of the name) that can be used with Interferon, or in some cases, completely replace it. I've heard it has next to no bad side effects like Interferon has, and can cure the HCV in a way shorter timeframe. I also heard it depends on the genotype of HCV the patient has, and their something levels (i forget what levels they check for, cells or something!? idr lol). But I'm not sure if this is actually in use yet, and/or FDA approved yet. 

So my question is, what's the name of this medicine/treatment? Is it in use at all yet? How effective is it compared to Interferon? And how long do you think it'll be before Interferon is completely obsolete and not needed? And also, isn't this new treatment way more expensive than Interferon? And is it true the genotype of HCV you have can determine the likelyhood of it getting cured more quickly/easily than others? And btw, when I say 'cured', idk if it's actually 'curable'. I think it might just go into remission, and not exhibit any damaging effects anymore. But if you were to get tested, it'd still say you have it for life. Is that true? 

Sorry for the long ass post lol. I've always been really curious about this but couldn't really find a solid answer on the internet. I would like to know because one of my good friends and running partners shared needles a few times and contracted hep c. He moved away and we don't talk much anymore, so idk if he started treatment yet. I've heard you don't necessarily have to get treatment right away after you test positive.

OH and one final question! I heard its possible to test positive for the HCV anti-body, but have your immune system fight it off, and when retested, show up negative for HCV because you technically had at least the beginnings of it, but your immune system just destroyed it on its own. Is that possible? Thank you so much for taking the time to answer everyone's questions. You're the best man! :D",cojrb9o,opiates,1423785011,n0dsquad,1,0

We drove a few blocks over back to the Mission area and parked across from a liquor store, about half of a block away from where we needed to meet the guy. We also needed to make a quick pit-stop before the deal went down because we were short some supplies to shoot up. Some fresh water and some new cotton would do the trick, we had everything else ready.

We both head in to the liquor store. I walk around getting the things we need and a few extras as Trev just waits outside the front door, smoking a cigarette. I was feeling a little parched too, so I was in front of the Arizona Iced Tea section when Trev popped his head in the store.

“Hey yo man, I think I see him down at the end of the street. I’m gonna go get him, aite?”

“Ok, sounds good dude, I’ll meet you back at the truck,” I replied. Wow, something that happened rather easily, I think to myself, maybe my shitty day is finally turning around after all.

I take my time picking out just the right drink. I was still riled up and it was a little bit hard to think straight. Not that it matters, but I specifically remember picking out the Mango flavor Arizona before I headed to the cash register to pay. I tried to use mostly the change I had grabbed from my truck, as to not cut in to any of the drug money, so it took me a minute to pay the asian store clerk. I was paying in mostly pennies and dimes, and if he was annoyed, well, he didn't show it.

I head back over to my truck, I hadn't bothered to lock it on my way in so I just opened to door and plopped down in the front seat. I take a really deep breath and let it out slowly, closing my eyes. “What a day,” I think to myself, “What a day.”

10 minutes pass, then 15...I start looking around to all the viewable street corners to see if I could get a view of Trev. Nothing. Another 10 minutes pass...and another…

After about a half hour to forty minutes I decide I’m going to call Trev to see what’s taking him so long, only to quickly realize he doesn't have a phone and that he had been using mine, of course. I reach for my phone.

It is not there. Nor in the ash tray, the side compartments, glove compartment, or under the seat. To my horror, I start realize there are other things in the car missing as well. My Dad’s kindle which I kept in my favorite grey backpack was in the back seat, but not any longer. My eyes notice Skeet’s canvas backpack, still stuffed tightly in the foothold. Also, I had a Rx for gabapentin to help with withdrawals that was in the glovebox, no longer there. There should have been a portable speaker and nice pair of white headphones in the center console, but neither was there.

“NO.NO. NO... NO... NOOO!” I shout to myself while banging my head against the steering wheel, letting off a few ‘honks’ in the process. “THIS IS NOT HAPPENING, THIS IS NOT HAPPENING.” I pray in desperation.

It was happening, and I was jacked (granted, due to my own stupidity) twice within an hour.

There is an interesting point you can get to with emotions like depression, fear, and sadness. It is where you feel so much of it, for so long, and in such great quantities, that there’s a point where you actually just sort of get so low that sometimes you weirdly feel like you popped through on the opposite side of the emotional spectrum. In other words, it was like feeling so low that I felt nothing else in the world could even hurt me. This feeling comes only sporadically in certain situations, but is very empowering.

At that point in the day, I was so absolutely numbed by the day’s activities that I was sort of wearing it as a shield at that point. I decided that enough was enough. Trev was not going to get away with this. Well, let’s be honest, he probably was going to get away with it, but not if there was anything I could do about it while I lived. I truly felt like I had nothing else to lose, and it was completely liberating. I had to formulate a plan quickly.

I run inside and beg the clerk to let me use the store’s phone for a quick call. Thankfully, he obliged, and I dialed my phone number. It rang twice, then went to voicemail.

“Good,” I thought, my phone was still on, Trev was probably still using it. My plan might just work.

After I got back in my truck, I made a fist with my right hand and punched myself in the cheek as hard as possibly could. I took a second swing and this time drew a little blood. That should do. 

The sun was starting to go down as I turned the ignition and floored it for the Bay Bridge.

The dope smelled like sweet, pixie stick'y scent, and when my boy snorted it, the drip was sweet too. I didn't notice it from shooting though. I only can taste like a certain type of dope in the back of my throat after sshooting. Its really hard to explain the taste tho, or why only certain types let me taste it after the shot.

I don't do coke anymore, but when I would shoot coke, I'd ALWAYS taste it in the back of my throat (It tastes like crack smoke, which I LOVE the taste of! ...fuck I wish coke/crack had legs, then I'd actually buy/want it)... that would be the first sign of the awesome surge of euphoria to come, auditory distortion, sometimes a full-blown bellringer, and if so, then prob puking too haha.

"Maybe I'm being sensitive, but im seeing comments that point at the idea of me being opiate naive and just plain ignorant. 

I'm saying this because I know that a lot of you probably have tried more hallucinogens than I have, maybe even benzos, but I would be surprised if there was anybody who has been using opiates for less than 8 or 9 years that can come close to relating to my experience with this amazing family. I have been prescribed only the strongest doses of the strongest opiates that many cancer patients will have a hard time finding. Whatever I wanted was written, so I could pick and choose which ones I wanted this month and which I'd want the next. Not to mention the amounts of these pills that I'd bring to the pharmacist would make it very tough for me to find anywhere willing to fill my shit, sometimes taking days of searching to get either a pharmacy that would or one that even had the amount. 

I know all about the worst withdrawals imaginable and have studied a lot about methods used to try and make them as easy as possible, and I have never been a fan of suboxone. I fucking hate that shit. There is more to it than just lope and subs and I am not gonna sit idly by suffering and watching others do the same while there are ways that I am fairly certain, on my own, I could kick and help others kick major habits in a day or two at most with less discomfort than your normal day 20 of being clean. 

I just want to be clear here that I'm not in fairy tale land wondering if my 30mg oxy a day habit will be too bad to get out of bed for a week. I wanna know what length of time my absolute hell will have to somehow be forgotten on the spot from a naltrexone induced detox off 600 mg shots of oxycodone 4 times daily for a year, chasers for the twice daily 400mg oc that's been swallowed or sniffed.... Or 300 mgs methadone for half a year... Or maybe 3 120 mg dilaudid shots a day with 600 mgs oxymorphone ER, opana, to just help me get that slight nod I was hoping for....

From there it is a simple matter to clone the signal. Two separate security researchers, Jonathan Westhues (in 2006) and Adam Laurie (in 2007), have demonstrated this ability in public.""

"Okay, so I just read all six parts of this, and it's awesome. What I love even more is that I know every spot you mention, since I've spent a LOT of time in the Bay. Henry Hotel, TL, Mission, I know them all quite well. It adds a lot to an already great story.

But seriously, I *think* I know Skeet. A while back, a dude called Skeet moved into the apartment next to me (in Sacramento) from San Francisco. He moved in with his brother, and he was a sheisty motherfucker; he said he pissed some dudes off in the Bay, and they wanted to kill him, so he left to let shit cool down for awhile. For a little while, I was hooking him up with dope through my dealer. My place got broken into once, not even a day after the one and only time I let him into my apartment. He saw the like 20 low end computers and the dozen random monitors me and my neighbor (who worked for Intel) managed to swipe from his work when they were gonna send it all to storage. We had planned on wiping them, reinstalling Windows and making sure it worked fine, then selling them. We had already done this with like a dozen already, selling them for $50 each for dope money; I had souped one up for myself and kept the nicest monitor. Someone broke in and stole them ALL, including the one I kept, as well as all my wife's jewelry and a couple other valuables. Also, we once left my wife's awesome pipe, which had real gold blown into it (she worked at a smoke shop, they had given it to her for her birthday), outside, and it disappeared within 15 minutes. I'm completely sure it was him both times. 

After a few weeks, Skeet changed his name to Suave (pronounced ""suave-ay). He would go out to houses across town and break into them, stealing all sorts of shit, but especially prescription drugs. If he didn't know what they were, he'd bring them to me for me to ID them. Usually I'd just tell them what they were, and he'd offer to sell them to me. I hope this makes you feel better: I ripped him off a couple times. I would tell him the pills were like Motrin or something, and say hey, I could use Motrin, lemme keep these, and he would. I did this with Tramadol, Cyclobenzaprine, Ativan, and even Dilaudid (what kind of junkie doesn't fucking know Dilaudid?) and Duragesic, which is fentanyl.

"I just wanna jut in here- I've been a junkie for like 8-9 years now, and have travelled all over the country for work, school, vacation, festivals/shows, and mostly visiting friends (to see shows lol). I almost always am prepared with my DOC appropriately (enough to get high as well as enough to taper off and avoid violent WD if it's a long trip), but after that my mind honesty kinda scatters. I've forgotten alllllllll kinda shit, from a week's worth of shirts to deodorant to my wallet and passport or license. It's nuts, I have my masters and am a pretty smart dude, but organization just doesn't happen in my brain

So I just wanted to say that for some people, forgetting important stuff does happen a lot. Fuck, the last festival I went to last year, I *barely* remembered to bring my credit card at the last minute, and good thing I did because we were leaving from LA and going to the festival in Phoenix. Without the cc I wouldn't have been able to pick up my ticket (or it would have been immensely more difficult). Maybe he is in a similar situation and really needs the cc?

Also, I know I can't speak for all junkies, but friendships mean a lot to me. When I am traveling and someone offers me coziness/warmth/safety, it is one of the truest blessings in life (im not homeless either, I have a nice bed actually- but someone opening up their home to you is incredible). I try very very hard to ensure that I meet that gesture with respect. I've never taken anything from my friends except once, awhile back, and it's a gray area id say.... We had just seen phish in Hollywood, and we were staying at a friend-of-a-friend's place down there to avoid traffic while tripping our nuts off haha. When we got there after the show we started making some food and I made some comment about how I wished I had something for the comedown. Dude hosting made a comment about the percocets in his bathroom cabinet. I thought he meant they were up for grabs so a couple hours later I took all 5 of them. Apparently he wasn't offering them up, I found out the next morning lol, but I apologized and told him what I thought he meant by that comment, and he didn't really need them anyway so all was forgiven with a 10 dollar bill lol. 

As for this situation you have- the #1 most important thing is that you don't let him get in the way of lotus tonight!!!!! This is **YOUR** night and your show just as much as it is his. Do whatever you need to do at home to feel secure with him around, and have a hella good time. After the show, use it as a time to rejoice together as friends and revel in old times.

"&gt;I feel bad for you if you ever have to go through withdrawal..

My doctor doesn't know the half of it (once my pain is under control, I'm fucking slaying the dragon, it rules my life and I fucking *hate* the shit, what kind of paradox is that?), and at my prescribed dosages she said that no doctor should ever try to make me go cold turkey because I'd end up in the ER seizuring or dead.

Trust me, I'm a reluctant king. Never asked for it, never wanted it, never ever once chased that high on purpose...and yet drugs are simultaneously keeping me alive because my pain is at suicide-level without them, and ruining it all at once.

&gt;I've even taken 40 5-325 hydros at once in a pathetic attempt to kill myself, I barely got high.

That makes me clutch my liver. I can feel it if I take like 12 norco at once my liver immediately inflames and complains (I don't drink either, nor did I ever abuse hydros in my teens when I was on 'em) for the next three days.

600mg lope, loperamide like immodium? Or is there places to get that straight or something? (I just imagine not being able to shit for months...)

&gt;I'm 33 days clean and still going through physical withdrawal symptoms.

"So, what is it that I am justifying?  What is it that I am in the wrong here for?  Do you know why I'm on these medications?  Well let me tell you.  I started taking these medications after I was misdiagnosed as a Type 2 Diabetic.  Yes, incorrectly diagnosed.  That means that my blood sugar stayed exuberantly high and instead of fixing the problem and starting me on an insulin regimen, I was told that my high blood sugars were because I was either not taking the meds or I wasn't sticking to my diet.  This went on for over 7 years.  After 7 years, I began having really bad pains in my legs, feet, hand, arms, abdomens, etc.  It wasn't until I moved to another state and found a new doctor that I was told that I was not a Type 2 Diabetic, that I was, in fact, a Type 1 Diabetic and that I should have been on insulin all of these years.

It turns out that the pain in my arms, hands, legs, and feet as well as the severe abdominal pains were manifestations of severe Diabetic Peripheral Neuropathy.  A result of the constantly very high blood sugar levels in my body attacking the nerves in my body.  It was my Primary Care Physician as well as my Endocrinologist that began me on the Opiate Pain Meidication.  It was the Opiate Pain Medication that allowed me to move and have somewhat of a normal life.  Of course the normal life I lead is only a resemblance of what it once was.

These medications barely work as it is now.  The other doctors I have been speaking with were actually talking about possibly upping or at least changing medications to compensate for the lack of effectiveness.  This Physician's Assistant took two looks at me and made a decision that I needed to be on 3 Oxycodone 15mgs a day instead of 4.  She made that decision after spending 5 minutes with me.  While doctors that have spent 2 to 3 years with me think otherwise.  

But yeah, you're right.  An addict is an addict.  There is no other context here to be had.  The Physician's Assistant did the right thing by changing my meds after spending a total of 10 minutes with me.  She did the right thing and an addict is an addict.

I hope that you never have to ever take pain medications and I hope that you never have to depend on someone else making a decision about how your quality of life will be.  You think I want to be on more pain meds?  You think I want this to be my life?  If it were up to me, I wouldn't take another pain pill for the rest of my life.  They don't even feel good anymore.  They're an affliction.  Especially when you didn't start out looking for a high.  I started using pain medication out of necessity;not out of an attempt to get high.  In fact, I wish I got high from these things because it might make my life not so fucking shitty.

But yes, please tell me how an addict is an addict and how the clinic did the right thing.

"Do you like something.  Anything?

It's no different ... and it's really not necessarily destructive behavior.  People live long, natural, healthy lives taking opiates ... every day.

Lets say *You* like to masturbate.  Someone, or something in your life (a girlfriend or a wife perhaps) has influenced you in such a way that you no longer masturbate.  You've decided with them in your life, your life is much better ... not masturbating.

You don't stop because it's *truly* unhealthy, simply because it's unhealthy given your current circumstances.


Then your wife leaves you ... first you're upset.  Then you remember the things that you stopped doing for her ... and get a massive raging hard on in anticipation of all the masturbating you're about to do.

This is the same sort of excitement someone feels after deciding to use again.  The same sort of thought process they are going through when they want some, but know they shouldn't.

Not because it's inherently *bad*.  Because it *ISNT*.  Rather because given their circumstances (the law, their financial situation, etc) it is a bad idea.",cor0cux,opiates,1424396131,orangesunshine,3,0

For me this is enough to get me going in the am, sometimes I will take a little more ecp if I need a little more get up and go. I do this through out the day, after dinner I will relax and let my hair down but not to far down. I have been doing this for over 30yrs.

"The difference is this.

If Tramadol caused seizures then it would mean that the person taking the medication has no predisposition for having seizures and the seizure came from Tramadol completely.

Tramadol lowering one's seizure threshold means that the individual has a predisposition for receiving seizures and the seizure did not come from taking Tramadol alone.  Instead, taking the higher dosages of Tramadol lowered the amount of catalyst needed for the seizure to happen.  

Now, before you repeat your claim that you've never had a seizure before taking Tramadol in higher dosages, I will point out that people can still have predispositions for having seizures without ever having a seizure.  It just means that you haven't reached a point in your life or had enough catalyst to have a seizure induced.  

There are many studies that show that Tramadol does not cause seizures.  I can look them up if you are interested in reading them.

HOWEVER, the danger still remains that someone could still take a high dosage of Tramadol with the thoughts of ""I've never had a seizure before so I'm okay"", and that would not necessarily be correct.  Again, you may have a predisposition for having seizures and you've just never had a seizure up to this point in your life.

"Cops are LITERALLY the stupidest god damn people in the US. I've heard articles/reports where they literally hire only lower IQ'd people to be cops, since they don't want smart people (which would question why they're doing the retarded shit they're doing, and ruining lives over BS laws), they just want low IQ order followers. And then people wonder why shit happens like those idiots not knowing how to deal with the mentally ill, or them killing unarmed people, or people's dogs, raiding the wrong house/address, just being general idiots, etc.

I have no sympathy for them and every time one dies I have one of the biggest smiles I'll probably ever have (other than when I get a ton of dope or something lol). I love when Karma takes care of those fuckface statist thug legal gangbangers. People have had enough of their bullshit, since they know they can get away literally with murder with little to no consequences, so people really need to take shit into their own hands, since the 'system' sure as fuck wont lol. 

As if those scumbag life-ruiners deserve to live anyway. I'm sure all the unarmed people they've killed (and are proud of killing) would have liked to also. 

not surprised I went this off topic this quick (again). But anything involving cops makes my blood boil. Its just so ironic that the US was founded because the 'man' was being unjust and forcing their citizens to do retarded shit, so they went to war and gained independence. All our founding fathers (if still alive) would never allow this to go on. But then again, they steal money from us (taxes) to create all these ultra powerful weapons and shit, making a revolution almost impossible it seems. But even small victories are good enough in a way. One dead cop is still something to throw a party over, esp. if they were killed in the 'line of duty' and not just cancer or something. Bonus points if they suffered while they died.

I actually spent a year in two 12 step fellowships (AA and NA) and they were both really...uncomfortable...for me. Being someone who's openly queer (bisexual and gender non-conforming, to be precise!), etc. I had the misfortune of standing out. And in both fellowships, it'd either attract people who wanted to fuck me or it'd attract people who wanted to save my soul. While I made sweet friends there, it's not something I would ever want to do or try again. (The only reason I even went is because I couldn't afford going to Rehab After Work or Gaudenzia and my addiction psych wanted to stick me onto methadone.)

The slightly amusing part of my adventures since leaving is that now that I'm back to using again (dissociatives, psychedelics, and probably opiates soon), I'm actually happier now than I have ever been.",codryho,opiates,1423279976,tachibanakanade,1,0

wikipedia:  ""Tapentadol (brand names: Nucynta, Palexia, in India available as TAPAL by MSN Labs) is a centrally acting opioid analgesic with a dual mode of action as an agonist of the μ-opioid receptor and as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor.[2] Its analgesic properties come into effect within thirty-two minutes of oral administration, and last for 4-6 hours.[3]

It is similar to tramadol in its dual mechanism of action; namely, its ability to activate the mu opioid receptor and inhibit the reuptake of norepinephrine.[3] Unlike tramadol, it has only weak effects on the reuptake of serotonin, is a significantly more potent opioid and has no known active metabolites.[3][4] Its general potency is somewhere between that of tramadol and morphine,[5] with an analgesic efficacy comparable to that of oxycodone despite a far lower incidence of side effects.[6] "" ",conrbp1,opiates,1424142927,4II0,1,0

"I know, bruh.. so do subs...everything
 costs money... what's the point? 

 you will probably want to wait at least 24 hours before taking a sub, so you will be sick at least a little before you can get on the subs. I had precipitated wd's after waiting a full 24 hours before,  so you have to be super careful. Is tar the same as ecp in terms of how long it halflife? I know they are both # 4, but tar has the extra alkaloids, so I'm not sure how that affects how long it's chilling in your receptors.  

Also, whenever I switch back to subs from dope, there are about two days where I don't feel very good, I'm slow at work and don't have a ton of energy.  Everybody is different though. I've been on them for years so maybe that had made shit different for me.  

My feeling is that if you can pull it off, you should just try to live it up and enjoy your DOC before you go to rehab.  I'm speaking from multi rehab experience, and I think it's best,  at least for me,  to try to enjoy myself before really focusing on getting clean.

"Good for him for getting sober. I truly hope that it lasts; your sister and you deserve a sober father. Ultimately, it is your choice whether you want to fight for a good life, or if you want to give in to a life of misery. It sounds like you are romanticising the darkness, and it is anything but glamorous. I do understand how you feel though. It feels like it might be exciting, it's tantalizing to let go and see where it may take you. It seems like a better option than remaining on the same boring path of life that ""normal"" people do. But it doesn't have to be like that. You can find excitement in life that doesn't involve you knowing the torture that is drug addiction. It may seem tempting, and exciting at first... but it stops being fun VERY quickly.  
  
Soon you wake up sick, exhausted, drained. You can barely convince yourself to drag yourself through everyday. You NEED to use, even though it doesn't get you high anymore. You need it to feel normal. It is not glamorous, it will not make you feel better; I absolutely promise you that. Ultimately, it is your choice. But no matter how tempting it is, I promise you will come to regret it.  
  
One day you will look back and wonder why you didn't listen. You will lose everything, and you will have no one to blame but yourself. You will probably wind up withdrawing in jail, with no loved ones left who give a shit that you are enduring torture. And you will only have your own poor choices to blame.  
  
You are staring at a crossroad in life... there are two different paths that you may walk down. One of them only leads to pain, despair, and probably death (not only your death, you will see many friends die from overdoses). The other path leads to endless opportunities, you can take it anywhere you like. I would give life a chance. You can always change your mind, but once you start, you will think about it and be trapped forever...  you never truly escape; you will never be the same, and you WILL regret it.",co7aiwu,opiates,1422754878,the_red_beast,2,0

4) don't trust yourself to pay yourself back money you shouldn't be spending 
5) always have a story for why you're late 
6) don't buy anything valuable. You'll end up getting rid of it when you're low on cash. Just use the cash for what you're going to inevitably spend it on and save yourself the guilt and the percentage  you loose after resale.

They aren't expensive but in the states it can be tough to get them. You have to go to a pharmacy and some will sell them no questions but others won't unless you have a prescription for insulin etc. It depends on the pharmacy's own policy and the state I think. The other option is needle exchanges but those are usually found in metro areas with big IV drug problems so aren't available to a lot of us and if they are a lot of people would have to travel well out of their way for that. I guess the last option would be mail order but most people usually aren't that far ahead of the game.

You can but they are completely different highs so I doubt it will mix well. You probably will end up wasting the trams. Also that isn't perc just call it oxy or something. It has become a pet peeve of mine when people use the wrong slang for pills. Percocet literally means with acetaminophen. I'm sure you know they don't make perc above 10mg and just use perc as slang for oxycodone but its incorrect slang and may confuse people who don't know.,cot3eux,opiates,1424574990,hunterESthompson,5,0

"from my experience, if someone is set on trying heroin, they're going to try it. however, you are absolutely not in any position close to most anyone i know who has. i know people who were as privileged/well-off as you, but they'd at least tried harder drugs before too. slow your roll and try some fucking benzos, man. considering the fact that you seem to be a clean, nice, white girl, hell, you can probably have them prescribed to you. benzo addiction is no walk in the park either, but i think it's a pretty solid alternative to *i'm gonna do heroin and then kill myself!!!* 

to be honest, it doesn't sound like you're even that bent on trying it. you're turning to a bunch of junkies on reddit to remind you of how decent your life is when you're clearly well aware of that. yeah, duh, being a good, well-off person is more desirable, at least definitely to someone in your position, than being a junkie. you know that, i know that, everyone here knows that. stop seeking affirmation from anonymous junkies on reddit about how okay your life's resources are and go take advantage of them, ya dingus!

Is 100 bucks a gram aka $5,000 extra bucks) and he moves about half a brick every week if not sooner. So 5000 EXTRA just to burn some sugar or add coffee to some of the stronger dope on the street here at the moment.

I'm real tempted to start collecting good karma and get the guy to front me. 2 or 3 oz at a time. He doesn't like fucking with smaller deals and I have no problem with that. If I stepped on it 10% that's about a quarter extra worth of dope (still strong enough to send ya to nod city off a twomp) which is about 400 extra bucks. If I sold the shit real close to my price it'd sell like hotcakes and there are so many D boys that I wouldn't attract the local blood gangs hold on territory as I'd be home delivery.

"Hi there, after reading your post I feel like I identify a lot with you. We seem to have similar situations- I have been using opiates for about 2.5 years straight with only a few maybe 2-4wk periods of sobriety within. I also work and am a full time student. So i really understand the not having the time to go through wds. Thats where I always struggle as well- I decide to stop or at least take a break (usually because I run out of money or need to pay rent/bills etc) and I get through a few days and then cave in feeling like its either i continue wding and get fired and fail my classes or get high and keep on keeping on.
BUT- I have just recently (within the last 2 months) gotten to a place that I can honestly say I am comfortable being at. I now use only on the weekends, twice a week at most and some weeks not at all. I now am (very slowly but surely) getting back on my feet financially; my drive both academically and in my career is back and overall I am just in a much better place than I have been for over 2 years. 
Anyways, I'm rambling I need to get to my suggestions for you... I feel it is important to start by saying something that is said a lot but I think very underrated- there is no ""quick fix"" as you know, it will be difficult but the keys in my opinion are planning and mental determination.You have to take steps both mentally and literal actions to get ready to get off the ops(or cut back). AND you must mentally stay focused on your goals and find ways to keep yourself determined to stick to your goals.
So, I am just going to outline what I did to cut wayyy back on my use. I hope that my experience can help you by hopefully providing a starting point for your own individual plan. I feel I also need to add that obviously everyone is different and you will surely need to do some things differently than me or anyone else because no two people are the same, not even addicts :).
So, what I did first and one of my main suggestions to you is to ween off as much as you can while still keeping yourself comfortable. Obviously you have been finding a way one way or the other to financially support your habit so continuing it while doing a bit less than normal should be very plausible. 
Then, if at all possible find some suboxone- you said a script is not an option which is also true for myself so i find it ""on the street"" so to say. I have no idea what your situation in LV is (I live in Nebraska) but for me it is difficult to find subs but not impossible. This is where planning comes in again, while you are slowly lessening your dosage look for subs. it took me about two weeks to accumulate about 6 subs- which in my case was all i needed. I suggest trying to create a ""stash"" of suboxone- keeping it but not starting to use it yet. Like I said this may take some time to accumulate the amount of sub you believe you will need. For me this part was a bit difficult because I hated spending money that could have gone to pills on suboxone that I wasnt even using/needing YET but i was determined to make a change. 
At this point I had enough sub to make me feel comfortable enough to begin detox and i had successfully weened down my dosage to a little less than half of what it had been just three weeks before. This is when I picked a day and wrote out a plan, it may sound silly but for me this was a way of solidifying everything and holding myself accountable. I gave myself another week of using but still weening down with two more nights (friday and saturday) of getting as high as i pleased. The following Thursday (I choose thursday because I thought it would be easiest to not start my wd directly following my ""binge"" weekend nights as well as because friday thru sundays are the days I personally have the least amount of engagements) would be my first day with no opiates. 
I also wrote down that I would not allow myself to do any opiates until I 1.did not feel physical wd symptoms anymore 2. did not need sub to feel normal/ avoid wds.
Then, its just a mental game. My plan was simple- use the sub as a tool to get off the opiates but NOT as a crutch. I told myself that I would do sub only when I was feeling wd symptoms and I would only do enough sub to make me feel better- no more than necessary. I forced myself to wait out my wds a bit on the first day- I managed to go about 36 hours between my final dose of opiates and my first sub dose- by that point I was feeling incredibly horrible but I thought it necessary to not just do the sub the second I started feeling sick. For about the first 4 days I needed 1/4-1/2 a sub a day.  After I got it down to 1/4 a day comfortably (day 6 for me) I again had a mental talk with myself and started to push myself longer and longer between sub doses. I only would allow myself to dose when I physically (not just mentally) started to notice wd symptoms. I went as long as I could between doses and got to 1/4 every other day. For me, after this it was just a matter of taking the jump- it was almost completely mental at this point. it only took me two weeks of sub- i then went two more weeks with no sub and no opiates. ever since then I have only been using once a week. 
You mentioned addictions meeting in your post- I personally have never utilized them but I have friends who have and find them very helpful. I was lucky and had a close friend that was getting off opiates at the same time I was cutting back. We used each other often for support and feedback. It really was invaluable having someone to share the experience with. It seems silly but having someone to talk to that understands is very helpful. I would highly suggest meetings or something similar if you do not have any friends who have been through addiction.
As I have mentioned it will be different for you but I really hope that this post in some way helps you. If you have any questions feel free to ask me.",coj2p1a,opiates,1423729516,ayyKaraA,2,0

You might find yourself getting super comfortable and watching movies and not moving, or going through a video game and getting super into it when its a game you don't normally care for or you might clean your room or finish a project you haven't had motivation to finish.

I've posted on here about her before because she is the only grandparent i have left and it's at the point now that we don't even go see her if we have a cough or a cold or some sneezing going on, because the tiniest germ/infection can turn to pneumonia within hours of exposure. It's fucked up dude. Hopefully you aren't nearly that bad off though. Do you have to breathe through that really loud machine for like half an hour 2 or 3 times a day? And also, is your COPD a result of genetics or something (you said you've been having an asthma attack for a month and that just doesn't sound like it would be caused by something external like smoking, but I dunno anything about it really)

Anyway buddy, I hope your lungs/throat/respiratory system gets balanced out here soon! I think I got pretty lucky with my upper respiratory system. Besides my fucked up tonsils that got taken out years ago, my biggest problem is keeping a few nose hairs trimmed lol. I can't imagine having chronic trouble breathing!

Even though I make a cocktail and sip it, the amount you sip over a period of time has drastic effects on how it effects your cocktail. Although it adds an amazing edge to the high by strengthening the benzos and opiates without adding that uncomfortable drunk feel and adding such great warmth, it is simply too dangerous.

Alcohol is just dangerous, in general. But as I am high right now and the alcohol-warmth is spreading through my body, I don't regret a thing. Clouds n shit.",coq674o,opiates,1424333721,timoyster,0,0

"Hey. Yes, its possible...hell, its usually the way it goes! HCV is a slient disease, usually with no symptoms. Or, the symptoms are pretty mild, snealk up on you slowly so don't notice how crappy you feel until you get cured. And thats whats happening now; With the newer more effective treatments, folks are getting cured and are blown away by how good they feel. They had no idea how much HCV impacted them until it was gone.

The real risk you had is in sharing needles. Sexual transmission of HCV is pretty low in HIV-negative heterosexuals...its so low that they don't recommend condoms if your parther has it. Sharing rigs and other injecting equipment is where the risk lies.

Get tested: It takes 20, 30 up to 40 years for HCV to do significant damage to most people. If you're negative, then you're good and don;t have to worry about HCV. If you're positive, then you can talk with your doc and see if you can get cured and treated. The drugs are expensive and sometimes hard to get, but I can help with that if the time comes. Finding out your status is the first step.

Maybe cut the 70 in half and see how that feels first? You can always take more, but wait a good two hours to see how you feel. 
I'm a pretty small dude, and have come close to ODing before, but sticking with my rule of ""you can always do more"" has saved me the hassle of almost dying many times. I once got some black tar H from someone in Colorado while moving from Washington state to the East coast. I was used to the quality of tar in Washington to be that of the ability to take gram shots. I bought a half gram from a guy and proceeded to put it in my spoon. At the last second before putting water in the spoon, I took out about 4/5 of that half gram. That .1 of a gram had me like if I had done 2 grams of tar in Washington. If I had done that whole bag, I'd be dead right now.

"In the end, some of us are probably better/stronger/faster versions of ourselves through our self medicating. I have always had generalized anxiety which lead to depression, huge genetic component in that. In some countries, people drink. They drink a lot. In the USA, we have access to numerous opioids that other countries don't have, so we use that to make our lives easier. Because, tying your shoes sucks. In Thailand, the locals hang out and chew raw Kratom leaves. Raw kratom leave pleateu at 3-4 leaves.

"Hello. I can tell you that while using opiates during pregnancy is not the best idea, there are far worse things a mother to be can do. What I will tell you is this. While using opiates doesn't pose a horrible risk to the fetus...withdrawal does. Your baby could DIE. You need to see a doctor that can properly detox you when you decide to tapers. Also, you know that OB/GYN's drug test, right? If any one of those pops up positive, they WILL call OCS when your baby is born. Also, once you reach about 16 weeks, there is something called meconium. They sometimes take it and test that, it will show anything you used during your entire pregnancy. If your baby pops positive, they WILL call OCS. ",cog0a0c,opiates,1423495287,NoTimeLikeToday,7,0

"Ok calm down everyone.  This was not a dig at Tracy....


Am I wrong though by comparing the two situations?  I was just using her situation as a comparison, although opposite ends of that spectrum they are.  She did a documentary following her lifestyle around with random people (who happened to be HBO), he let a random website delve into his lifestyle I am sure in a similar way.  But I don't know the details of either situation but I am sure the payoff was not worth the exposure it caused.  Maybe one day down the road somebody remembers you from it or maybe they don't

Are you all pissed off cause its Tuesday and you're broke/dopesick or is the snow stopping you from getting your fix.  Relax a little.  Not everyone is persecuting you or your tribe.  Again I dont know why everyone is white knighting for Tracy, as I was not insulting her at all nor was I being disrespectful.

&gt;__Om__/__Aum__ (ॐ; in [Devanagari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari) as ओं *oṁ* [õː], औं *auṃ* [ə̃ũ], or ओ३म् *om* [õːːm]) is a [mantra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantra) and mystical sound of [Hindu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu) origin (geographically India and Nepal), sacred and important in various [Dharmic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dharmic) religions such as [Hinduism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinduism), [Buddhism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buddhism) and [Jainism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jainism). The syllable is also referred to as __omkara__ (ओंकार *oṃkāra*) or __aumkara__ (औंकार *auṃkāra*), literally ""om syllable"", and in [Sanskrit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanskrit) it is sometimes referred to as *praṇava*, literally ""that which is sounded out loudly"".

&gt;Om or Aum is also written ओ३म् (*o̿m* [õːːm]), where ३ is *pluta* (""three times as long""), [indicating a length](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluti) of three [morae](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morae) (that is, the time it takes to say three syllables) — an [overlong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_length) [nasalised](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nasalised) [close-mid back rounded vowel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Close-mid_back_rounded_vowel) —, though there are other enunciations adhered to in received traditions. It is placed at the beginning of most [Hindu texts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_text) as a sacred incantation to be intoned at the beginning and end of a reading of the [Vedas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas) or prior to any prayer or [mantra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantra). It is used at the end of the invocation to the god being sacrificed to (*anuvakya*) as an invitation to and for the latter to partake of.

"I honestly don't think it's fucking me up mentally, it did make me question my sexuality though for a while.   I mean I've seen on reddit posts saying that basically if you're willing to do gay things you must be at least bi and I really thought about that. I literally looked up male actors people thought were hot and tried to see if I could get turned on at all and I've  ever felt that way. I've never been actually into the deed, If I'm being blown I pretend I'm somewhere else having sex with one of my ex girlfriend's(I picture them because I can remember how the looked when they gave me head or when I was having sex or when they were actually orgasming and to have a chance of cumming I really need to pretend that what I'm doing. In all honesty, as weird as this sounds, I'd rather blow most guys than get blown. As long as they are clean and don't have like a 1 inch dick, it's so much easier and faster. I take forever and can't cum more often than not which they hate(they ALL want me to cum in their mouth so they can swallow, something that grosses me out so much i could never do it). For them, since they aren't exactly getting some very often, they cum super fast and apparently I'm quite good now so the average time it takes is like 1-5 min. I've only ever had one guy take longer than 5 min and the average is probably 3 unless they stop me so it takes longer.  And honestly when I'm  doing the deed I basically find what they like(takes like 5 seconds) and do that exact same thing until they cum. I put my mind somewhere else and just go at it. I'll think  about dope, I'll think about literally anything but what I'm doing. 

I will admit something tho, there have been times where I was in withdrawal kinda bad which made me really emotional and I've started crying a little bit when someone was blowing me. Thankfully the withdrawal made it so easy to get hard and cum quickly but I was got insanely depressed about what I was doing and where I was in life, what had happened to my hopes and dreams, etc. How I went from having a bright future to letting a dude blow me for a days worth of dope money. 

That paragraph will probably make you think that I am fucking myself up mentally but honestly that's basically the same way I feel when I'm working in  fast food, spending all my money on dope, selling dope, etc. It's the dope addiction that's fucked me up  mentally, not the prostitution. Cuz I've had the same feelings after cashing my shitty paycheck, throwing up cuz I'm so sick and waiting for my dope dealer about to spend all the money I earned in 2 weeks in 2 minutes. At least this way I get a lot more money and spend a lot less time doing anything. 

As far as safety goes, I have a knife but I would only use it if I felt like my life was in danger for real. Even that drunk asshole didn't feel like that much of a threat and he wasn't.  And no  I will never ever take any thing in my butt, not a chance in hell. If I can turn down 800 bucks to just *try* to fuck someone, I certainly can turn down an offer for my ass.  There is the remote chance someone pulls a gun or something and rapes me but considering I rarely even advertise anymore and just go back to clients I've had for a while, that risk is very low. 

I also don't need to do nearly anything at all that's very sexual for my 3 main, repeat clients. I mean like 50% of my money comes from those 3 and 1 of  them is like 2 or 3 times a week where I literally don't have to do anything but let him massage my feet and occasionally tickle them. 

I'm going to write about those 3 in a separate post if you want to read it. Sorry f or  how long this is, did some meth which I very rarely do. ",col5jie,opiates,1423907373,Throwawaymhooker,2,0

"Ok so the hydrocodone is generic vicoden/norco with Tylenol. It Is a decent opiate if you don't have much of a tolerance, you've got 7.5mg so they are pretty decent. It is used to treat moderate to severe pain. acetaminophen COD-3  is codeine and Tylenol good opiate for people with zero tolerance or very low tolerance, a step down from hydrocodone.The methylphenidate is generic Ritalin. It is similar in effect to an amphetamine, a legal speed basically. Used to treat ADD.Hydroxyzine has a few different uses. It is technically an allergy pill but is also used to treat sleeplessness, and anxiety. Its often prescribed with opiates. It has the added bonus of potentiating the effectiveness of opiates. So It will go great with the hydro or codeine. It may help take a little bit of the edge off the Ritalin as well.The daily maximum dose of Tylenol is 4500mg and the maximum recommend single dose ( at one time ) is 1000mg.",copei8n,opiates,1424281763,hunterESthompson,3,0

I just use my hand to hold back the seeds as I pour so that they don't come out all at once, basically straining through my fingers first.

"That's is awful.  My dealer is a chick and I am like her go to guy whenever she needs help with shit like any form of home improvement needs or going with her to handle business if she doesn't feel 100% comfortable going solo (im far from an overly intimidating guy but obviously a girl rolling solo is not ideal when you're dealing with strung out fucks),  she also has me make drops for her pretty regularly.  Anyway,  she always makes sure I'm taken care of for my time.  I never go home with several grams or anything crazy but I'll show up and she will immediately give me a shot of of bth and crystal to do (I mix both 99% of the time I shoot up) cause she knows I'm gonna wanna get right before whatever mission she has planned for me, then once we are done with everything and get back to her apartment she almost always kicks me down straight away which will range from a  .3 to a gram of each (bth+crystal) depending on how much shit she had me do and how much risk was involved. The we both do a shot together and I'll hang for a few and head home. 

One thing I've found when dealing with people who are gonna pay you for your time or services in drugs is to get things agreed upon up front in terms of the amount of drugs they plan to pay you.  With the chick I mentioned above I don't have to worry about it but when it's any other person I always get it figured out up front.  Unfortunately people talk a big game when they need your services but once they got what they need from you they get a lot less appreciative. 

I have this crystal connect who hits me up a lot for rides because he doesn't have a car and serves a lot of crystal and it's always the same story... ""hey man can you do me a huge favor?  I need a ride from  here to here then over here then gotta pick up my lady and get a ride here but you know I'll totally hook you up fat and take care of you and you know I got you"" then when it comes time to pay up his idea of hooking me up looks nothing like what he described or I was expecting for my time and the risk I just underwent.  He had  taken advantage of me like that a few times and I always kick myself after like fuck man what a fucking waste of time for this little amount that I could have bought myself and not dealt with all this shit. now I just cut to the chase immediately.  ""yea I got you dude where do you need to go?  Alright for sure,  what are you thinking about breaking me off for that because I have a few other hustles planned for today so don't wanna leave myself hanging you know what I mean.

"Thanks for taking the time to talk to me and share your own personal experiences. 

As for me, I know I am on a very slippery slope. I'm on painkillers now because I have what is considered a rare brain ""disease"". I put disease in quotations because it's more like a malformation but for whatever reason it's considered a disease. 

Before I was diagnosed and had brain/spinal surgery I would just dabble with pills and that was it. Of course I enjoyed them and they would help with pain that I was having but at the time I never really knew what the pain was from. By sheer luck I finally got a diagnoses. It seriously happened right in time because I was almost paralyzed on my whole left side and would have killed me in no time. So pretty much the surgery saved my life. I was doing well after surgery and never really needed meds but, would still take them occasionally to get high. To make a long story short I got pregnant and after I had my son all my symptoms came back full force. (I never took anything while pregnant). 

So here I am now in my late 20's with a toddler and my sisters kids whom I have custody of and I need pain medication to be able to function on a daily basis. If I don't take meds I can't even get out of bed some days because the pain is so bad. I know that sounds like what every addict says and I know I am now addicted. I wish I didn't need to depend on them but honestly I'll be on pain meds for the rest of my life. At this point I'm out of options and it's all about pain management. 

But, as far as loosing my mom...I've learned to deal with it anyway. It's still hard but I manage. I watched her deteriorate to nothing while I was pregnant. She actually passed a month before I had my son. So I definitely had a hard time with that and I'm still working through it. And honestly what didn't make me spiral out of control with any type of substance when I lost her was the fact that I was pregnant.

Sorry for the long rant. If you didn't feel like reading all of it I understand lol. Just feels good to get all that out some times.

"We need a back story to answer that.  Are you detoxing? Are you going on maintenance? 
How big was your habit prior to detox? 

I recently switched from methadone to subs,  went from 5mg methadone to 12 mg subs (8mg twice a day),  that was in August,  I slowly tapering down to do it right this time and avoid relapse,  because I've done the quick sub detox over 49 times over last 6 years an eventually relapsed every time.  
I know it's another addiction,  but it's an addiction that doesn't get you high and maintains your neurons in order for the time being,  giving you a chance to recover emotionally and make nessesery life changes. 
Once you are ready you can come off suboxone,  as long as you do it very slowly and correctly you won't have the ""terrifying""  experiences people describe.  It can change your life.  

Sake story with methadone,  I felt 0.9% of wd symptoms when I tapered off it,  because I did it how Dr's told me instead of rushing it. 

With that said,  if you don't have good income,  you qualify for medicaid which covers generic Suboxone,  so you got no excuse) 

And yes,  you can take up to 16mg a day,  everyone is different if you still feel very sick up the dose.  But keep in mind that you will feel restlessness and minor detox symptom even with higher suboxone dose.  
If you decide to go on maintenance it would be a possibility that you will have restlessness and anxiety symptoms due to dose being too high at that point.  Then you should slowly lower it an see it if helps. Il

I've never even heard of anyone od'ing snorting but the bags were quite strong. It's certainly no joke and the danger with fent is the high is shorter and more intense and it's more likely that your breathing will be dangerously depressed when compared to more traditional opiates like heroin, oxy or morphine.

"In my experience, taking gaba beforehand kinda puts a damper on the high and the rush. I have eaten them and timed it so I did a shot exactly 20 mins later, just before the gaba starts doing it's thing. That actually felt pretty good. So IMO, as long as the dope gets up to your brain before the gaba does, it will add a nice sedation on top of your high. However, if you do not have access to any form of buprenorphine or methadone,  i would save them for detox. They are the absolute best for some people, myself included.

"I am 30, and have never abused opiates. I did use them when I got my wisdom teeth extracted, and I think I may have felt a little something...enough that I got nervous about it and told my husband to hide them from me. See, I knew my brother was struggling with a heroin addiction, and addiction just runs in my family, so I didn't want to take a chance. I got through the rest of the pain with ibuprofen.

My brother was smart, funny, popular, loved... but had his demons. And once those demons were introduced to heroin, it was a bad combination. He ended up dying at 28 of an OD. His addiction started with a legit script, for a very hurt back (worked construction and UPS, he had an MRI and really did have a jacked up back). But it wasn't long before he was abusing those, and then heroin... but even at his lowest times my brother looked ""normal"" to everyone else. Only the closest people to him knew he was using. He never got a chance to hit rock bottom... never got arrested, never got in a car accident, etc. He also never stole from anyone. I think that was like in the back of his mind, he wasn't an addict because he never stole from anyone. But none of that mattered... so my advice, don't try it. It's not worth it. This sub will definitely spark your curiosity, but please take it from a sister who is still grieving the loss of her brother, it is not worth it. ",copn0dc,opiates,1424294972,worriedsick1984,4,0

I think your getting the wrong impression. I am not abusing my medicine I am prescribed these pills and understand addiction to know that after taking Norcos for 2 months that I am physically addicted to them. Therefore if I stopped cold turkey then my homeostatsis would be thrown off and my body would go into withdrawal. Hence the need for medical detox...I mean I had surgery so there wasn't any other choice but to use the drugs there wasnt any alternative... Had to have the surgery and why would I sit here and suffer in pain when I have medicine. I mean like I said I am not taking it to get high I am taking it as prescribed and for chronic pain. But if the shot Lupron works in these next few months I will go to detox and will stop taking them. I mean it just makes sense to me....I don't know how anyone with an understanding of the disease of addiction could call me a coward when I am more than willing to do what it takes to stay healthy. I hardly think that taking prescription pain meds as prescribed and understanding that my body is physically depending on these drugs to fiction daily without being in tears from chronic pain makes me very brave.

Then stick your needle halfway into the cotton and slowly draw it up. If you want filter it twice through a new cotton each time. 

But maybe you should invest in some micron filters if you're feeling this worried. A q-tip is better than nothing but still plenty of stuff can go wrong. They should be available at your local needle exchange. It is more effective and more sanitary. 

Also I assume you know what you're doing, but still, just a PSA. Do not cook heroin and coke together. If you cook heroin at all (I don't heat makes your dope lose potency and I use sterile water).

People can always be bigger than the negativity their brain subjects them to is what I was trying to say, thing is its scary and fucking hard.

Do you think starving child soldiers fret about why theyre feeling blue? Think about the big picture and you realize almost all of us have it better than like 90% of humans that exist. So you hate your job, so you have no friends, so you do too many drugs. First world problems are fixed very readily by taking the initiative to do something about it. Its SO FUCKING EASY to feel sorry for yourself and get lost in whatever hopelessness you think you are in. Its addicting to feel down, depression has wicked momentum. 

It all boils down to one thing though, like it or not, sack up and fucking better your life. No one wants to hear that though, it offends those not willing, or not aware that they are the only ones able to fix it.

I said 99 out of 100 earlier, because things like traumatic head injuries can damage brain structures that regulate cognitive function, in which case things like hormone replacement therapy(believe it or not) can be miracles.

I'm a graduate student and have many responsibilities, including presenting work, course assisting, attending journal clubs, etc. I am also extremely anxious (gee, who would have guessed that from a graduate student?) and am prescribed a total of ~3mg klonopin per day. It does wonders for my anxiety, but I find more and more often now that I will find myself forgetting what I was talking about mid sentence. It's incredibly embarrassing when this happens to you, especially when it's around co-workers / advisors / ANYONE who you want to know you're not retarded. I have definitely noticed that when I'm in the middle of a serious conversation (or really any conversion for that matter), I have to work way harder mentally in order to focus and pay attention / stay in the present.

At the moment, I still think I'd rather trade these occasional slip-ups for something to quell my anxiety, but I know that every day I continue on this path is just digging myself further into a hole and that benzos are a temporary solution-- they HAVE to be if you want to stay sharp.",co943xt,opiates,1422912656,madscientistyo,1,0

"Neck and fem in your thigh are always options. You gotta research and know what you are doing for those two, make sure you know where the veins and arteries are so you don't mix it up.. Have you tried all the tricks? Drink a bunch of water, hot shower, exercise like push ups or something be for trying to hit. Try different length needles than what you've been trying. Make sure you are using a nice new point. At least sharpen it with a striker on a match book or a wetstone. I'm sure you've tried all the usual spots for veins. Inside of the wrist forearm, outside of the forearm, ankles, the area around and behind the knee. There are lots of places. Look up a diagram for ideas on where to check. Most important though in my opinion is patience, don't try and push unless you are positive you are in, it can make it harder to hit in that area, try not to get upset and blast it in even though you aren't in a vein. If I start to get worried about my rig clogging ill take a second and draw up another ten units of water to keep it from getting too thick. Use bigger gauge needles. If you are using 30 or 31 the clog real easy. Try a 28 or 29. Also if your blood is too thick from a bad vein or not being hydrated enough those small gauge needles sometimes can't register properly.

"The ""forgetting words"" is a form of aphasia ... and is pretty common for me after taking opiates.  It's much like taking any psychoactive ... there are going to be cognitive effects.  The ""mind-fog"" isn't really indicative of neurotoxicity.

Alcohol is probably 100x more neurotic.  The headache you have from a hangover is indicative of neurotoxicity.  When I've had bad ecstasy and the like with piperazines instead of MDMA I've had almost the same kind of hang-over you get with alcohol.  It's really odd, since piperazines tend not to be at all like an alcohol inebriation ... but the hangover and headaches being nearly identical go to show how much of the alcohol hangover is merely just neurotoxicity.

Also, neurotoxicity from drug or alcohol use is really fairly innocuous ... once you stop the chronic drinking/drug-use your brain returns to normal very quickly.  The really dangerous things are the odd reactions like they've had in Vancouver a few times from smoked heroin where the user is left completely disabled after a few uses.

I do encourage people to take tolerance breaks every now and then, but unless they want to suffer withdrawals just to go right back to getting high again, using things like Loperamide, Lyrica, or even just Suboxone to hold them over during the break while the tolerance drops to their liking is really the only choice.",codfchw,opiates,1423255453,hoodyhoodyhoo,2,0

"You might have nicked an artery, as those are the exact symptoms of doing so (pain right away that travels away from the heart and out towards your hands/feet depending on where you shot it, if you make it in the artery you might draw back brighter/kind of frothy looking blood, and crazy swelling that can take quite a while to go away. Sometimes the swelling is so bad that people can't move their fingers/toes/etc.)

 Your friend could have had a more morphine-y batch that caused a histamine rush like morphine does. The morphine rush causes a feeling of hot pins and needles to kind of spread throughout your body, or sometimes it only affects certain parts. From my reading, and experiences, it seems to affect the scalp, hands/palms, feet/soles, and for some people, their asshole, more often than other areas if it doesn't cause a sort of all over pins and needles type feeling. Some people love the feeling while others, like myself, hate it. Some people grow to love it. A lot of the people who like it seem to describe it as a ""hurts so good"" type of feeling.

If you do get something start small. You can always do more but never less. Also why would you think that doing heroin one time would be throwing your life away. That is a terrible attitude and if that's the way you are going to think you shouldn't use it. Heroin is for responsible people that respect it. Use only in moderation and only what you can afford. Make smart decisions and do your research. Be aware heroin can be deadly if not used responsible. But by no means is using it a guarantee of throwing your life away or a guaranteed life ruiner. Just be smart and respect this amazingly wonderful drug. If used properly it can greatly enhance your life.,cov7x7g,opiates,1424750283,hunterESthompson,1,0
"  Foil shiny side down, about the size of a cd case is perfect. 
  Make your tooter out of foil so you can unroll it later and smoke the residue. Make the foil a rectangle about 5"" by 10"" and roll it tightly around a bic pen, cigarette, etc to where it's 5"". If it's rolled too thin it will get hot. Squeeze taper one end to mark the mouthpiece and keep it rolled better. I also make a halfway deep pinch in the center in a perpendicular direction to the one on mouthpiece. 
  Put desired size piece of BTH on corner of flat foil square. Until you learn to control the trails you may want to use a small piece so as not to run out of room. You don't want to run a new trail over an old one bc it doesn't slide right and if it doesn't stay sliding it will burn. Flick the lighter under the foil (under tar ball) for a split second to seal it to foil so it doesn't fall off. 
  Hold foil at a pretty steep angle. Like more than you feel is necessary. Almost vertical. Hold lighter far enough under tar on foil that it doesn't instantly burn and slowly raise it until it makes it slide down foil. Practice until you find perfect speed to make opaque black, not translucent yellow (too fast), or black trails with burnt up chunks on it. Perfectly executed they will be completely smooth and black. 
  You'll want to hold the tooter above and behind the piece (maybe 2"" back) following it as it trails. Take the biggest hits you can hold in. I think 10 seconds is a perfect length to make sure you've absorbed as much as possible. Exhale.
  Repeat as necessary, turning the foil at 90* angles whenever you approach the edge. If it gets too close to the edge and touches the flame, it will flare up and burn up instantly. Major bummer. 
  When you get your technique down you can get artsy and make cool designs with the trails and not miss even a tiny cloud of smoke! It's not that hard, but does take technique. 
Have fun!!
  


--edit--
I didn't mention to roll the tooter shinyside-in so that the residue will be on the correct side for when you smoke it later... And I mean quickly later; by the time you've put a half through it, it has enough to get you well. It builds up fast enough that I always am baffled that some people still choose to use pens, straws, rolled dollars, etc 😁....

"You are pretty good as far as having stuff to get rid if the physical symptoms. With even just lope and gaba you shouldn't experience hardly any physical symptoms. If you are addicted to the needle or the process of breaking down a pill or patch, then the mental strain and anguish will be your biggest issue. Not trying to freak you out, but I have been through it and I think it's important to prepare yourself for that. The boredom, anxiety and shitty thoughts might be enough to push you to use. My tip is to have some stuff planned out. Movies, shows, video games, etc. You might even be able to walk and go different places with the gaba and lope if you add some caffeine in there.

"I feel you buddy. I've been practically screaming all day, every day, 24/7 about the pain in my ankle for over a year now. Got some X-rays last year around this time and the podiatrist saw ""a little damage but nothing major yet."" Scripted me tramadol a few times, like 30 every 2-3 months. Fuckin lame

Then as things progressed to be worse and worse and worse I finally got in with an ankle specialist over the last two weeks who basically told me I needed to go straight to the hospital and prep for surgery immediately because things are so bad down there. My podiatrist was focusing on the bottom of my ankle where it joins my foot, and there really isn't much damage there tbh. But the top of my ankle, like where it joins to my shin and leg, is fucked up almost irreparably. If I'd waited another 6 months-year I could very well be looking at being disabled for the rest of my life. I have surgery in fewer than 48 hours now. If we hadn't been able to schedule the surgery so soon, she said she would have scripted me perc 10s to get through February (may have had to have waited until the end of March but luckily she had a brand new opening this week from someone who cancelled their surgery right before my appointment). Of course I have nothing rn because she doesn't want my tolerance to rise pre-op. But the point being, it's bad, and im not crazy for ""imagining"" this pain

The fucked up thing about it all is that over the last two years I've been horribly horribly shamed by many people in my life because I'm only 28 now, and im not ""supposed"" to be in any pain that is severe enough to need anything more than Advil once or twice a week. I got guilt-tripped by my bro constantly for not having the energy to play with my 3 nieces, all of whom are under the age of 5. My parents bitched at me every time they saw me for how much weight I'd gained (I've gained prob 30 pounds in the last year and a half since I've been relatively immobile). And that's just the tip of the iceberg with my family, this pain issue has driven wedges between us like never before because they accused me of lying/exaggerating/imagining/whatever the pain. Telling me im tryin to fucking ""take advantage of my situation"" or take advantage of them, whatever the fuck that means. The reason we didn't know what was wrong is cuz they wouldn't spot me the $321 copay I needed for proper MRIs. Until this month. And now they're eating their words at record speed, now that they've heard the surgeon explain what is wrong 

 My friends were more understanding, but they also just thought I was being a lazy fucker, trying to just go on vacation or something? And it's like... Fuck that, I'll never have a vacation again if I can get rid of this pain!!!! There are 6 different spots inside my ankle that are being either replaced, reinforced, or reconstructed. One bone is completely missing. Another one is detached from its place and is entangled in one of my torn ligaments. It's *really* fucked and I can't wait for it to be fixed 

I feel your pain about your kids though. I don't have kids, but like I said I have 3 nieces who I love to death (and my sister in law will be delivering a brand new set of twins in May or June!) and my career is built around working outdoor adventure camps in the mountains. Which obviously I've been incapable of doing for 2 years now. It's horrible. It's depressing as fuck. I don't be a 28 year old invalid.... !!!!!!! If you have legit pain issues, keep pursuing a solution. It may take over a year before anyone believes you (especially if you're a young-ish, strong-looking white boy like myself) but eventually you'll find a doctor who will listen to you and work with you to find out what is wrong

If I had listened to the world and believed everyone that I had no real reason to be in pain..... I could very well have ended up being unable to walk more than a few dozen yards at a time for the *rest of my life* because the joint would have deteriorated past the point of repair.

"Actually,  reg first statement,  that is not true,  relapse is a repetitive use and being unable to stop.  What you described is called a ""lapse""  and doesn't cancel out your sobriety days (unless of course you do it monthly,  weekly etc But then once again that's description of relapse) 
I am a living breathing proof of the fact that there is a HUGE difference. 
 If you slip/lapse for a min and get back to your life and continue recovery where you left off -your life is fine,  you might even benefit from it by realizing a mistake. 
 If you relapse your life is screwed again and you have to start over your treatment.  Even thou in both cases it teaches you,  the length of set up is tremendous in difference,  like a pin to a highway

Quote from first link:
"" Lapse vs. Relapse: There is a major difference between having one slip and having a relapse. A lapse represents a temporary slip or return to a previous behavior that one is trying to control or quit (usually a onetime occurrence), whereas a relapse represents a full-blown return to a pattern of behavior that one has been trying to moderate or quit altogether (Marlatt &amp; Donovan, 2005). If someone is on a diet and trying to lose weight, they might have a lapse if they eat one piece of chocolate cake. If that same person gains 25 pounds while on their diet, they most likely suffered a relapse""",cof5igv,opiates,1423420505,Casually_Insane,1,0

"I've been using my groin for nearly 15 years now. In and out in under a minute.  Just gotta make sure you don't get your artery which is right beside it. I use a 23 gauge / 30mm (blue) spike as it's pretty deep but once you find it its a breeze. Start with an empty barrel and draw back. If it's red go ahead if it's pink stop and think (arterial blood is light red/pink).

To find the vein place your middle and index finger together and feel for your pulse. When you find your pulse place your middle finger over the pulse.  With your index finger right up against your middle finger (which can feel your pulse) the vein should be under the middle of your index finger. 

To be sure dry shoot first (use an empty barrel and draw back to make sure it's dark red) . Some people need a green spike which is even bigger than the blue (like a fuckin dart) because it can be deep. Mark that fucker when you find it with a sharpie or something. 

You'll probably be shaking like a motherfucker at first as it's weird seeing a needle that size going into you. 

And by the way, miss a mil or two, hopefully you won't lose a leg as you won't get surface abcesses but deep fuckers that need surgery to get out. I've had three hospitalizations.  On one they missed the abcesses and thought I had a clot (another fun thing from shooting in the groin.) Well that cunt grew and grew and the nurses couldn't understand why I couldn't stand upright.  I was like yoda all hunched up and in absolute *agony*. They took a scan and ill never forget the doctors face when she looked at the results.  You hear of colour draining from someone's face but to see her go snow white and quiet. She actually ran from the room and came back with some specialists about 20 minutes later to say we're taking you to surgery right now this instant. 

Well after surgery I use told they removed over three litres of puss from inside my lower stomach area. Normally an access would stay in the local area but for some reason it grew up into my intestinal area. No wonder I couldn't stand upright.  Imagine shoving a three litre bottle inside youself. Everything else gets pushed aside.  And I'm a skinny cunt, not much room for anything. 

Anyhow if you're still going to use your groin make sure you keep it clean (alcohol swab before injection) and *don't fuckin miss*.

Wasn't my last time in for abcesses. Still using to this day but only dabble now.  Maybe once or twice a week at most. Sorry for the wall of text. 

P.S I know too many people that have lost legs from not being careful. My doctor always tells me don't use neck hands or legs for banging. Feet and arms are okay. But once you find your groin, man its so handy you can do it anywhere you can drop pants for 30 seconds (really is that quick. Although after 15 years of using both sides of my groin I gave pits the size of the end digit on my pinky. Well about half as deep and probably an inch long).

P. P.S. If you have a needle exchange program they should offer safer injecting classes which are worth a visit. Also the groin doesn't work on people with a bit of weight (chubby people sorry).

"I used to never want a sitter, until I was on 6 tabs with two other friends. We weren't so thankful for the sitter for any reason having to do with having someone actually take care of us- what we DID need was someone with an attention span of more than 4 seconds. The three of us tripping were having this really intense conversation about trying to describe to each other what we were experiencing and wondering if we all experience the same thing but just think and therefore describe the experience differently. Before the sitter came, we'd completely lose track of our progress like every 30 seconds and have no clue wtf we were talking about hah. So, I think sitters can be good or bad. A drug-naive, potential judger? Fuck no. Someone who knows exactly what you're going through and is just there to chill with you and help you think through whatever you're trying to think there? Sure. Although I also enjoy solo trips- it's great to trip with friends, but it can also be nice to experience it for yourself without worrying about whether your fellow tripper(s) are feeling okay.

"This probably doesn't help you, but in the interest of spreading knowledge and info, here in the UK, needle exchanges will, when you first visit them, take your initials and DOB. Then, theoretically, you give them the same details whenever you go there, or use a number they've assigned you. If they're being conscientious about what they do, they'll log what syringes/paraphernalia you take each time. (Also, in one pharmacy, the first time I went, I had to do a longer questionnaire about my drug use, and my injection practices.)

The reason they do this - and I believe they're legally required to - is so they can provide the government with these basic statistics; the government can see the average age of IVDUs and so on. Needle exchanges here also supply all the kit that bodybuilders need for steroid injections, so they'll also have a basic idea of what injectable drugs are 'popular' where, that kind of thing...

I don't really have a problem with this. I have more of a problem with some pharmacies that act like they won't give you what you need if you're not returning anything (that is, you don't have any used stuff in a sharps bin to give back). I've never actually been refused, but they've said things along the lines of, next time we won't give you anything. In *theory*, yes, the idea is that used equipment can be disposed of safely, and like the name suggests, you're *exchanging* old for new, but the safety of users should be paramount here. When they threaten to not give me anything I feel like showing them a syringe I've been using for a week or something, all blunt and clotted with blood, and saying 'fine, I'll carry on using *this*!'

To be fair, most pharmacies, and certainly the couple I use a lot, don't do this. What's weird is that the packs of equipment they dole out actually vary in content. One place I went to once *only* had syringes in the familiar grey bag. Another time, I got all ready in a coffee shop toilet, and realised I had everything, except the grey bag didn't have any spoons in!

So it's all about identifying the stalwart pharmacies that have what you need and are happy to give it to you. If I go to my favoured place, the 2ml pack is fine: citric, filters, spoon, 2ml barrels and 1.5"" points. All you need otherwise is a lighter! They usually offer sterile water amps too, as well as the little thing that cracks 'em open. 

My second favourite place, I actually have to ask for two things: a 2ml pack, and a 2ml sports/steroid pack. I didn't used to, but the regular 2ml pack comes with 2ml barrels, but the pins are 1.25"", and after using my fem for quite a while, these aren't long enough, so I need the 1.5"" or even 2"" points from the steroid packs. The packs at this place come with vitamin C sachets (the steroid packs don't, of course) rather than citric, which is unfortunate; I prefer the latter as it seems to dissolve crack slightly better.

"BTH leaves a bit of heroin in the cotton. I have seen some washes come out darker than the actual shot. If I put a dub in the spoon then I am definitely gonna have dope left in the cotton. One time I used a cotton twice and did about a half gram in that cotton during those two shots. I did the wash the next day before picking up so I could get well and I actually felt a small rush and it got me well. Since tar is sticky it can stick to the spoon and cotton so doing a wash can get you well if you used a decent amount of dope. 

If you only do a dime shot then there will be hardly any wash and you're just risking cotton fever for no reason but large shots do tend to leave you a decent enough wash to risk cotton fever. And if I can get well enough to walk to the dope house then I am all for it.

And some people save all of their cottons for emergencies. I have put ten or so cottons in a wash before and got a decent buzz from them. I actually save my cottons now in case I know I will be sick for a couple of hours. Then I can get well for those two hours.

"Hey...no worries on the redundancy of questions: They come up a lot, but thats a good thing. Here's some answers:
1. You can only get HCV from someone else. I've heard this one before though, so it leads to confusion. HCV is blood to blood, that is: Someone else's blood gets directly into you. You can't infect yourself.
2. HCV progresses slowly, and for some, it never progresses to the point where the liver gets so damaged as to no longer function, but it does usually progress. By itself, its 20-30-40 years before the virus causes so much scarring that the liver stops working well and probelms can arise. If some drinks alcohol, or gets infected with HIV, then the speed where the damage happens pretty much doubles. Hep B speed up HCV disease progression too, but only if some has active hep B. If they got vaccinated or cleared it on their own, they don't have hep B. Waiting acouple of years won't be so bad, especially at your young age, but its still worth testign and knowing for sure. Liver enzyme tests aren't an indication of HCV: A lot of things can lead to high liver enzymes. Only an HCV antibody, followed by an HCV viral load can determine if a person has it.
3. Most folks have no symptoms at all for years and years! Fatigue, depression, joint pain are the most common, but most folks have the symptoms sneak up on them so slowly they don't notice it. Don;t go by presence of symptoms to see if you have HCV: Only a test will tell you for sure.
4. Yes, if it goes untreated, HCV can lead to death: Liver cancer, liver failer and so on. It usually takes a long time to get there (see above:20, 30, 40 years), and not everybody gets there (some live a long life with HCV), but there's no way to predict who will live with HCV and who will, say, develop liver cancer. I say treat everyone now so we don;t have to worry about who dies and who doesn't. Treat and cure everyone, and we don;t have to worry it.
5. Coffee is great for the liver: 2-3 cups a day has been shown to slow cirrhosis in folks with HCV. Vitamins are cool, but make sure they don't have iron in them. Milk Thistle is good for the liver, but not while on treatment. Some people don't think herbs are helpful, but I work with a Chinese medicine practitioner here in SF and I trust it.
6. I don't understand this question is asking; What does HCV do to the body? It has over 500 boldily functions so it can impact just about anything.
7. Yes, even without a cure most folks will live a long healthy life. But, with a cure, everything gets better (they've studied this and every measure of quality of life seems to improve!). If you're treated young and have little to no scarring of your liver, you'll live as if you never had HCV!
Hope this helps.

"As I see it, there's four main areas where help can go:
1. Prevention - getting the message out there that opiate addiction is a one-way street
2. Harm reduction - for those who do use, minimising the risk of health complications and death.  
3. Treatment - making a variety of treatment and support options  accessible for those who want it
4. Support - for users, family, friends - education, psychological support, practical help etc.
(I guess there's also 5. crime/punishment impact etc.)

Maybe touch base with your local services and get a feel for where where you think you might be able to help. It still shocks me how inaccessible and varied harm reduction and support services can be.

"I realise now that a lot of the terminology and language people use is bullshit for the purpose of making themselves feel better. People don't like that I own the term 'junkie'. They want to make a distinction between users and junkies as if one is the scum bag category and the other is somehow more respectable. The rest of the world doesn't see things that way, and telling them you're some kind of angelic exception does more harm than good. Some people who use drugs do shitty things and some don't. People out there who think every Heroin user beats up old ladies for money are not going to change their minds because you draw a linguistic line. 

People don't generally overdose on Heroin on account of the odd 'unexpectedly strong batch'. The vast majority of overdoses involve alcohol, benzos or both. 

Willpower can't cure cancer and it is not the answer to physical addiction either. Kicking drugs while you're young and resilient is more a matter of youth and resilience than willpower. Twenty years down the track that cold turkey isn't going to be the walk in the park you had when you were 24.

Using drugs doesn't make you a scum bag. Desperation can bring out the scum bag you always had inside. If you don't have it in you to bash an old lady for drugs, you won't do it,  no matter how long you've used or how sick you get.  Blaming Heroin for 'turning a great person into a cunt' is pure delusion. Heroin has no malice or motivation. If you have an inner cunt, it might come out under the right conditions. Heroin is not to blame. If it was, it would happen to everyone. It doesn't happen to everyone. 

Believing 'it won't happen to me'  with regard to addiction, disease,  desperation and the like is a really good way of ensuring it sneaks up and does happen to you. ",cowj0p6,opiates,1424853515,spentrentbentspoons,5,0

"$70 for the first week. .25 snorted twice daily, priced at 20 a point.

By the second week it would probably get to .5 snorted twice daily, so $140 for week two.

Week 3= ~.75 twice daily, 1.5 altogether. So $210 for week 3.

Week 4= .2 per day. $280 a week.

It would probably stay around .2-.3 for the next month, so then $1400 a month.

Then it would have a point where either it keeps increasing because you keep getting greedy and choose to do more to feel higher and higher or you stay at a plateau level with the same tolerance of .2-.3 per day and even then you're looking at only having enough money for MAYBE 1.5-2 months if you're lucky and conservative.

 [**Extended cycle combined hormonal contraceptive**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended%20cycle%20combined%20hormonal%20contraceptive): [](#sfw) 

---

&gt;

&gt;__Extended or continuous cycle combined oral contraceptive__ pills are a packaging of [combined oral contraceptive pills](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_oral_contraceptive_pill) (COCPs) that reduce or eliminate the withdrawal bleeding that would occur once every 28 days in traditionally packaged COCPs. Extended cycle use of COCPs may also be called __menstrual suppression__. 

&gt;Other combined hormonal contraceptives (those containing both an [estrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estrogen) and a [progestogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progestogen)) may also be used in an extended or continuous cycle. For example, the [NuvaRing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NuvaRing) vaginal ring  and the [contraceptive patch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contraceptive_patch)  have been studied for extended cycle use, and the monthly [combined injectable contraceptive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combined_injectable_contraceptive) may similarly eliminate bleeding.

Tbh, if you're taking a ton of APAP with hydro drugs, the dangers of that high dose of ibuprofen will certainly be extreme too. Like internal bleeding in your stomach, stomach lining erosion, internal ulcers, all kinda not cool shit if you take too much / more than recommended.

I was focused for sure and just regret not using it more productivley. When my feet and hands started going numb the fun was pretty much done. Thank god I somehow saved that 20 to come down with. Saving dope is no longer an option I can even consider but I was so focused about talking to everyone and anyone. I didnt even start thinking about the dope until like 15-16 hours after I shot that shit ( 2-4pm ) the 20 took the numbness away and took me down to a more reasonable level but im still feeling it a bit.

Im ready and so willing to sleep but I guess im not allowed to just yet.

"Are you talking about pure fentanyl powder or a mannitol-fentanyl mixture?

If it's the former, the risk of overdose is huge compared to fentanyl on properly laid blotter because powders vary in density even within the same bag and fentanyl doses are tiny, so one bump could contain three times as much fentanyl as another despite the two looking identical. Your tolerance would need to be inhuman for this to not be an issue.

If it's the latter, you're betting your life on the fentanyl being perfectly mixed into the mannitol. Pro-tip: it isn't.

Now, fentanyl blotters aren't safe by any stretch of the imagination but they don't have the above problems.
They're also convenient in that you can carry an entire week of doses neatly tucked behind the cards in your wallet, they require no preparation or privacy to dose and they can be prepared for IV much more easily than powder can.

In my experience, fentanyl blotters held under the tongue take effect within a minute or two. I don't know how this compares to snorting or smoking the powder.

TL;DR blotters &gt; powder

I'm a recovering opiate addict and this is triggering the fuck out of me. Now I cant even think of weed anymore without it being correlated with opiate use/addiction. USE TRIGGER WARNINGS! /dumblr''

orrrrrr: ''Fucking scumbag junkie, ruining the sanctity of sweet Ms. Mary Jane, and putting her around a bunch of degenerates like Mr. Needle(dick), Sammy tha Scale, The AntiHERO(in), and illegally obtained... kidnapped basically, Andrew Jackson's. OP is scum, a pathetic junkie, and most likely a drug dealer. He doesn't even deserve to possess weed, sell it, smoke it, smell it, taste it, even THINK about weed. Ms. Mary Jane deserves better than this asshole. That just goes to show how sweet and anti-discriminatory she is that she'd be with him at all (unlike us, we're just a bunch of judgmental retarded stoner assholes lol. but we dont do hard drugs so we're better than OP and everyone like him. Hurr I smoke weed but I don't do drugs at all, idc if thats contradictory since weed is a drug. We here at r/trees dont consider weed a drug at all, so its not. We dont do drugs we smoke plants! Fuck OP again.)

omfg and I realized, if you just post on /r/trees with out of those copypasta greentexts from 4chan's /r9k/ board, from the 'who /snitch/ here' threads, where it talks about a bunch of losers finally getting invited to a party, seeing someone with a huge bag of weed, them copying down the license plate number and calling the cops on them, having them go to jail lol. Obviously those are mad fake, but those idiots would believe them, and go absolutely apeshit on whoever posts them. Especially if they act like its justified, and act like you saved people's lives from a stoned driving menace or some shit haha. 

Sorry for the long ass post once again, I'm wicked jammed and nodding hard. I'm def contemplating on making a throwaway in a lil bit to troll /r/trees, and prob one for /r/drugs too. Hell, r/drugs is easy. All I'd gotta do is talk shit about mdma, lsd, shrooms, etc (basically the few drugs they only like/care about), and/or say that I like different drugs than what they care about, and they're hard 'scary' drugs like 'heroine' and crackaine. I was gonna say I'd ask ppl from here if they wanna help, but that'd backfire completely probably and we'd get shut down for allegedly planning a raid or some shit lol. Fuck... that...

Ugh goddammit... nearly everytime I'm mad high, I end up writing a huge ass comment, mainly cuz I keep noddin and thinking I only wrote a little, and I'm already mad talkative with no one to talk to lol.
I'll def try to cool it tho. I typed like more in one of my infamous 'mad jammed nodsquadding hard' comments than some ppl post in several months worth of commenting lmao.

Sry.. Hope I gave some people some good ideas tho. I know the posts above me did (which I now just realized that I prob gave them  the idea with my last big 'infamously too high af' comment which i think spaarked the idea flame to fuck with the retarded 'ents' and 'druggies/druggos/whatever the fuck u call those r/drugtards. 

And since we're not bropiates (god how i loathe that word), are we like Opitarians? (Oh-Pea-Uh-Tarry-ans &lt;--pronounced).

Jesus this keeps getting longer and longer! I know, I know, *thats what she said* lol. I forced the hell out of that joke in 7th and 8th grade till my teachers were enraged lol. I'll still never not laugh at a twss joke usually.

Welp, this is so far from the topic that its dead lost. Miles upon miles away from the topic with a dead phone, dead battery, no gps signal, gps was stolen anyway, car's engine is fucked up, and no ones around for miles whatsoever.

"Shitty. Still have lots of physical symptoms. They have gotten better but I still am sleeping in 2-3 hour intervals. The RLS is the worst I have ever felt and I went off a good dose of oxy. Still having chills and goosebumps a lot. Which scares me because when that finally goes away I know I am getting close to being done. Day whatever it is now and I have goosebumps all day long. It is wearing on me something bad. If I could get rid of the RLS I feel like I could sleep more and cope. I have tried pretty much everything at this point besides more opis to get some relief. Nothing has worked. The doc gave me baclofen and it didn't do a damn thing. I was given a decent bottle of lorazepam from my GP cuz I was so bad and begged her to basically just knock me out to get through. Once my pain doc saw, he cancelled my refill and put me on the baclofen. Said if I failed for benzos in a UA after the normal clearance time I would get hit with a positive and that would effectivly make things very difficult at the pain clinic or from any doctor in my healthcare network. So I flushed about 70 half mg tabs down the toilet because I knew how tempting it would be to pop 1-2 and get some sleep. So, all in all, don't do what I did. I tapered from 15mg in about 2 weeks and hopped off. Really regretting not taking more time. Now that I am so far, I would just feel like I failed if I take the methadone. Which I could easily get if I wanted. All I have to do is fill my script at the pharmacy. I am talking to my pain doc again today to see if I have any other options. I don't want to take anymore methadone. Maybe I can do a quick tramadol taper till the methadone is done murdering my soul.  I really am motivated this time to come off. I don't judge anyone who is on them. This is just my choice. People should do it on their own time in their own way, methadone or subs. I say whatever, good on you for trying at least. That is progress and I think people forget that. The person went out of their way to get better. I could care less if you shoot heroin even. It is your life. I would just tell you not to steal or fuck people over. Any other questions or did I cover it pretty well. I am quite ready to be done with at least the physical end of this. The stomach stuff went away after day 10 or so and I started to eat a tiny bit. Still I am in hell. Methadone isn't a normal withdrawal. Oxy and H are like running a sprint to come off. Methadone is like a fucking marathon. You aren't going as fast but it wears you into the ground. I am having crying fits still ( I am a disabled airborne ranger, I have really thick skin and can handle an above average amount of physical and mental abuse. This is fucking weird.

"1. I had tried quite a few drugs (but not nearly as many as some people on here) before trying opiates. One day I was finally able to get my hands on some 5/325 vicodins. Took 2, smoked some weed and had a great time.  
  
2. The high has a physical aspect to it that just isn't there with weed. No matter how high you get on weed you won't experience the same extent of analgesia you get from opiates. Or the ""not giving a fuck"" type feeling because of how absolutely amazing you feel from the euphoria.  
  
3. I only use occasionally so that my tolerance stays low and so I can avoid addiction.  
  
4. I would say they've had a negative effect on my social life. I've had to hide my use from most of my friends. It really depends on the person but the guilt from hiding it from certain people can get to you after a while. As for the positive aspect, getting high on opiates is better than every other drug I've tried.  
  
5. I've never binged on opiates since I try very hard to space out my usage.  
  
6. Know that physical withdrawals are the least of your worries compared to the social stigma, monetary cost, tolerance, psychological addiction and even death if you shoot up.",copw3sh,opiates,1424310441,buhder,2,0

One second I'm on the left lane then I'm not aware I've drifted to the slow lane. All that time I managed to keep a real safe distance from all the cars behind and down the road. Then I realized it was time to stop risking safety when I ran down 2 road cones they had set up for the median and exited to the nearest sit down food chain to simmer some.

"I'm sure that some of it is mental craving. I do have anxiety as well. But then sometimes I'm in a great mood, super motivated, but can't get anything done, and that's when I just get pissed as hell. 

The pain management doctor my insurance will accept, I looked him up and saw a lot of reviews about how he doesn't prescribe narcotics almost ever. I am definitely open to trying other things too, but I KNOW that opiates work, so it seems logical to have that as part of my arsenal. Plus that does help with anxiety as well. (But if it was JUST an anxiety issue, kratom or something else would probably be good enough.)

It is partly my fault because when I HAVE my meds, I feel great and don't think about it. Then when I feel shitty, I feel too shitty to be as proactive as I need to be. Stupid! I get into the mindset that anything I do isn't going to bring me relief fast enough so why bother. But obviously if I had just gotten on top of things, I'd have relief by now! Someone else here said they went through 4 doctors before finding someone to prescribe so I'm trying not to give up hope.

"Very common misconception. You don't have to heat it up in order to inject it, especially the powder. So, heroin comes generally in 2 forms, powder (ECP=east coast powder) and tar (which is generally found on the west coast/west of the Mississippi). The powder you absolutely do not have to heat up in order for it to be injectable, and its not a solid powder (that kind of seems like an oxymoron to me, no?).  you just add a little water (typically cold or room temp), stir it up a little, draw it into the syringe, andb there you go, you have a (usually) brownish liquid that you can inject and it's consistency is no different than water. Now with the tar, you typically do have to heat it up, but I've never done tar so I'll save that explanation for someone else who's more experienced in that field.

"Dope - fuck, make music, write, get overly romantic about all aspects of my life and express my undying love and devotion to the universe

I was gonna sit here and write all the various drugs out, but pretty much what I wrote for dope applies to every substance. When I'm dead sober I'm a morose motherfucker filled to the brim with a severe sense of ennui. It's not that I'm nihilistic, it's that ultimately death is the clearing at the end of the path and what happens in this incredibly small slice of existence that we call life is really a grim joke. 

To believe that I can truly manifest my will in any true way in an unlimited universe wherein lies an uncountable and unknowable depth of space and time...that's funny to me, really funny...laughably so. It is the egocentric folly of man to believe that life is about ourselves and our narcissistic pursuits.

I'm way too comfortable with mortality. Way too comfortable.

Anyways, that's what drugs do for me, they let me care. They get me out of my head and into everyone else's societally agreed upon definition of reality.

"I'm mostly from VA and NC but also lived near and copped in some of Washington DC'S worst hoods. It was sometimes sketchy but usually I was more afraid of police or getting ripped off than being shot at. I always tried to mind my p ' s and q ' s though.  Didn't try to pull any junky bullshit that might get me shot at. I've had my fair share of scary shit happen, and I saw a friend take two bullets in his legs rigjt in front of me, but I've never personally been shot at. 

 I feel like most hood violence is usually between people that live and hustle  there than on random white boys coming in to spend good money. 

I know that random shit does happen  and robberies sometimes go bad and guns come out. Maybe I was just lucky to avoid any if that sort of thing. I was robbed a few times, but it was more like the dude that was supposed to be grabbing my shit for me just never came back or I was sold dummies. No one ever stuck a gun in my face and made me cough up all my money and valuables. 

I'm not saying you haven't been shot at, but you just made it sound like it was something that happened a lot. Definitely not trying to call you out or anything man. Shit I'd love to hear those death defying hood copping tales if you ever wanna write one out. I enjoy crazy dope copping tales.

"I was going through this one middleman for a few weeks. Id only got a g from him once, a half g another time, and a 20 maybe twice.. Then on maybe the 4th or 5th time Id gone through him I asked for a g of bth.. I gave him 80, he went to go pick it up like he had done every other time. Then he called me to say he's on his way back, that's when I hear a cop in the background say ""stop! Put your hands up!"" Or something like that. Then he hangs up all quick and doesn't answer again for a day and a half.. Now, I know im an idiot for trusting him with my cash and not going with him or something like that, but I'm not so stupid that I was gonna believe that shit. I knew he was robbing me.. I called him like 30 times. The next day he finally calls me back and says he was in jail all night. He said he would've gotten away with it but I kept calling him and that's why he got arrested. No joke, this dick tried to put it on me. He said he had the cop convinced that he wasn't doing anything or some shit, but I kept calling and the cop figured out he was picking up for someone so he searched him and found my g. Then he had to spend the night in jail. I didn't believe him for a second. I told him to send me proof. He sent me a pic of his paperwork from the police station... Idiot didn't crop it well, I see a date on it, 2012.. I'm like bro, that paperwork is 2 years old.. He never called or texted me back again. Never answered again. Fucking dick. Nice try. You got my 80 bucks. Could've made a tooon more cuz I always broke him off well and gave him gas money. Guess he was hurting bad enough to lose a source of income... Or maybe he thought I would've fallen for it and given him more dope for having to endure a night in jail. Fuck that dude. Horrible middleman. I'm so glad I don't have to go thru middlemen anymore. Now that I go straight to the source I get sooo much more for my money. Now I middleman for people and get mad free dope for it haha.. But I never rob or ""beat"" anyone.. Fuck that shit.

"I think you have to tell your BF.  Addiction will convince you of anything for you to keep using,  you need a completely Sober pair of brains to support you. Trust me I've been there (not the pregnant part but thinking of it)  and researching the harming effects.  If something even sais : proven not harmful,  it's clearly at least not a plus for this baby.  
Just think about it like this,  for you it's a few months (don't know how far ahead you are),  for this person it will be 70?90 years? Of whatever might or might not damage them.  
In my other opinion,  it's a well known fact that opiates restrict oxygen in our brains,  which your baby feeds on as we'll be as dehydrate us.  
Also remeber how easy it is to OD on them due to inconsistency of quality.  And before you say ""I always test it first""  we all do,  but there always comes a time when you are already high and will say ""ITLL BE FINE "" and then you'll never ever forgive yourself and a chance of your child holding this against you for the rest of their life.

Look at people who were movie stars as kids. McCauley Culkin, Lindsay Lohan, and shitloads more. They're young and have more money than they know what to do with. What do they do? Become train wrecks.

I honestly wish I could have someone control my money for me, and be like ""No, you can only do 2 blues a day. It's too expensive otherwise.""

"There are a good amount of addicts who really don't get discussed imo, that are like you and came from a solid background and yet somehow found themselves addicted.  

I think where this article can speak to you and others like you,  is that even with a well rounded upbringing Such as yours,  you felt disconnected from the people in your life or something equally as important. The point of the Article is to highlight the overlooked role our environment plays in addiction.  Your environment may have not fulfilled you mentally (lack of stimulation through education or reading, access to therapy if needed, unstable mental health with you or family members), physically (lack of exercise, sex, healthy food), spirituality (  lack of opportunities to feed that part of your that needs to feel connected to something bigger then you ie religion, community,  philanthropy,world peace you name it) and/or social life (regular interaction  with family and friends in a strable and reliable way)   the article implies its likely a combo of these disconnects that drives an addict to reach for something else to fill that void. 

The reality is most people who have experienced trauma listed do not go on to become addicted. It's the imbalanced and disconnected life that drives addiction.

Awww Thank You! We love you too! I hang around here because this community is filled with some of the chillest people I've ever met &amp; like you said I have:

&gt;much respect for you guys.

With that said and this said:

&gt; I have never taken opiates because I know how much I will adore them, they would suit my indulgent side far too well. 

I would not venture into taking anything. Knowing that your best bet is to not expose yourself.

I don't think someone getting an opiate related tattoo is trashy at all, as long as the tattoo itself is beautifully done.

I want to get a red poppy with a string of small four leaf clovers. It symbolizes luck and I feel lucky that I got out of it alive. Four leaf clovers are also like, my thing. It's weird but I have always loved them since I found one when I was 6 years old and they mean a lot to me.

"The first sentence of that oath is, ""do no harm"" yet so many physicians are harming their patients by not providing (or referring and making sure it's received) proper pain control. A woman I knew through a friend took her own life because of pain, it's staggering to think how many more people out there are on the precipice of doing the same thing because there is no light at the end of the tunnel. 

Not counting the numerous conservative bowls of soggy dicks who won't use opioids for pain control d/t religious reasons or some of the nauseating hype surrounding opioids (**all** patients become addicted, chronic opioid therapy **will** lead to opioid-induced hyperalgesia, **no one** needs opioids for longer than a week because things like CBT are a sure fire way to kill pain), the rest of the physicians do not want to handle (or are unable to handle) the load of work that comes with chronic opioid therapy. I was told by a nurse once that there is a ton of paperwork involved that has to go to the DEA (may or may not be true) and the physicians have to be up to date on education, certifications, etc. before being ""able"" to prescribe COT for a patient. The doc has to make sure each patient is getting the right drug, right dose, right amount of doses, how well is it helping compared to xxxx, is their piss clean, is their pill count correct, pain diaries, so on and so forth. Some physicians I will call flat out fucking lazy bastards and chickenshits, others are incapable due to how many patients are in their practice because of a shortage of help. 

I honestly think it is going to take a large group of people with a very loud voice (and probably a lot of money) to make it heard that people in chronic pain are being violated by the very people who are supposedly there to help, and we are not going to take it anymore.

"I've done every combination of MDMA, dope and every reasonable ROA for each. Hes right you don't want to IV Molly. The most you'll want to do is snort it, maybe. But only if you have enough because snorting makes you crave a redose 10x more than orally, so you might find yourself still awake at 8am and about 1gram+ deep.

But honestly, there's a reason why ecstasy is famous for being in pill form, because most people (myself included) prefer it orally. Snorting it will have a much more speedy feel, while taking it orally is more euphoric and contentedly God-like. And I know it's hard to believe but you'll probably get more of a rush than snorting it too: When you snort it you start coming up in about 5 minutes, and reach peak levels 10-15 minutes after that, but when you swallow it, you don't start feeling it until about an hour in but almost as soon as you do you reach the peak. Every time I do Molly I'll just be talking or doing whatever an hour after taking it when BAM! I'm high as a paper kite.

As for the dope, I love the combo, although it does reduce the effects slightly, but I much prefer to save my dope for the comedown because then it's like the perfect cure and the comedown basically doesn't even exist for me at least.",cou3ppn,opiates,1424662617,ProjectKushFox,2,0

Then I just continued to chase the high I pictured in my mind, and just like that I was hooked. I know it seems like the answer now, given that it seems like the perfect-never-would-I-imagine option. Please rethink your thoughts. Despression is a bitch but it comes in waves of severity. You'll be over this hump soon and wonder why you ever was curious to put yourself in a very dangerous and avoidable predicament. I know we're complete strangers, but hit me up whenever if you wanna talk - about anything. Just thought I'd share my two cents and experience. Hope you're doing better.

"Brand usually isn't a good way to tell. What you should be doing is checking bulk sections for seeds that have a **LIGHT ** powdery blue colour, and, importantly, bits of poppy pod and straw still left in. That's a sign that they aren't washed, or washed poorly. Dark coloured seeds are completely useless and a waste of money. The same supplier will often have the seed quality change wildly from batch to batch. Keep a look out and check up on other stores, even when your current batch seems to be good, or you can find yourself in a bad place without much warning.

To extract, don't bullshit around with a two litre bottle like people say. If you have any sort of habit, you're going to need more than one can hold. I'll usually buy around five pounds or more of (good) seeds, which will fill a decent sized stock pot.

Buy some citric acid and an immersion blender. Throw about a tablespoon of citric acid into the mix and then dump the seeds. Add COLD (hot will just absorb into the seeds faster) water to the mix, until the seeds can flow past each other without piling up. Stick your immersion blender in and beat the living fuck out the mixture for a few minutes, making sure you're keeping the entire bulk of seeds moving, and knocking the opium residue off the outside. Wait until the water is a good, brown colour, then quickly strain the mixture. Add a SMALL amount of fresh water back and restrain, just to get the leftovers.

You probably want to add a little bit of baking powder and sugar to the mixture to neutralize the citric acid and help with the taste. If you did it right, it should be horribly bitter. The citric acid will have made the morphine and company water soluble, so it should start to hit pretty soon after you swallow the mix. Faster than a pill would, at least.

Note, though, that for anyone with a proper habit, enough to get dope sick, this isn't going to be cheap. I had better luck just copping greys.

If you're really just wanting to stop the sickness, buy some kratom and taper down with that. You probably won't feel a buzz, but you probably won't be sick, either, and that can help if you're trying to deal with tolerance. Cheaper than anything else, too.

"AT LEAST a 2:1 ratio.

But if its really good coke I suggest less to be safe. If 2 bags of dope gives you a good rush you need AT LEAST half the amount of coke.

What a proper speedball should feel like is the first 2-5 seconds you will feel the coke rush and if its your first time shooting coke, you will hear ringing/buzzing in your ears, your ears may ""close"", if your heart is pounding and you feel like its too much remember to BREATHE slowly and move around bro. Don't ever relax and lay down if you feel like the coke rush is too strong. There's no narcan for a coke OD, you'll go into a seizure, foam at the mouth, and your heart will stop. 

Anyway make sure there's enough dope so it overrides the coke rush after the first 5 seconds. If done right its the illest body high you will feel in your life, the perfect combination of upper and downer. If done wrong, you'll be lucky and just throw up from the coke rush being too strong.

Got to where I was only going 2x a week. You can get it to 1x a month with good drug tests. I only stopped because I lost my job and my car and had to move. Now there aren't any clinics within 2 hours. I have 3 herniated/bulging disks and scoliosis and can't get pain management in the town I live in. I did that for a couple years before I got on methadone.,co8h6bn,opiates,1422855427,hunterESthompson,1,0

"&gt;Which imo is bs all opiates are the same as far as addictiveness goes. 

So fucking true. And it's all subjective too, I see some people take shit without a problem for years, same dose, same effectiveness, etc, and others skyrocket in their tolerance, etc, some get hooked on morphine but not oxy, or dilaudid but not morphine...it's all individual body chemistry in the end. I read a nightmare story about this poor girl who had chronic pain and her body was actually totally opiate resistant. Like she'd take oral pills and they just would not get absorbed. They of course labeled her a drug seeker until they did an actual study of how the medication went through her body, monitored her blood levels the entire time, etc. I can't even imagine that shit.

&gt;Sorry I didn't mean to offend you. I wasn't making fun of you because you did say you weren't hip to the drug culture. 

Nah, you didn't offend me at all. :) No worries!

&gt;I totally get your point about opiates being a monster or dragon being more descriptive for sure. I just had never heard it as a catch all. Always specifically in reference to smoking. Never even heard it used about injecting. Maybe its a regional thing.

I think it might be a regional thing, at least in how it has evolved over time. Like you explained before, I definitely know the origins of the term, but people definitely seem to use it as a catchall.

&gt;As far as the coke oxy coctail. Those work damn good. Its a fairly common method. I didn't see anywhere in the comments here or post that mentioned your routine or even specifics of drug in relation to dose. Maybe you meant you've mentioned it in another post altogether though.

You *do* mean coca-cola, not cocaine, right? I've never heard of anyone dissolving them in soda and mixing with IRs before actually! But, then again, I think we've already proven I'm not exactly Mr. Narco-suave here. I mean, I had *assumed* at least some people were doing the same thing to degree, but in relation to ERs I mostly see people bitching on forums about how that's all their dealer's got, the WD's are killing them, etc. The pill dissolves enough in soda after around an hour to knock one back and kill the worst of the WD's while you wait around for the other shit if you're hard off, but I keep hearing of weird shit like people trying microwave off the coatings and stuff, lol. That stuff is plasticized all the way through. When your mix is ready the next day it looks like someone snotted a GIANT loogie in your cup. Goes down that way too. Gotta hold my nose while I swallow it or I'll throw that shit right back up because of the slime feeling.

&gt;I assumed it was oxy and I was right and that is a shitload but its no where near the top daily users when you factor in heroin and stuff.

Dumb question coming your way again. How do you do equivalent dosing between heroin and oxy? The numbers sound so off to me, but I've got no experience, so.

&gt;However im sure you're at the top of the charts for Oxy. Especially legally! I don't know and haven't heard of anyone getting oxy scripts that large that aren't terminally ill and even then it can be considerably less or have to take multiple different drugs.

Eh, I've been pretty honest this whole thread that way over half of what I'm taking isn't prescribed to me. I won't break down the entire list but let's just say I'm pretty terrified to finally come clean to a doctor once my pain levels have been treated via some more traditional means (there are some retarded doctors around my area, it took five years to order a full back MRI and by that time I'd fucked myself good because no one caught that shit early). In fact, I'll probably be asking here and on /r/ChronicPain how I should go about this. It's obvious that I'm always probably going to need *something* (my condition is degenerative so it'll get worse, not better, and I've got a few compounded conditions to top that off), and I don't want to burn my bridges completely, you know? It's a real complicated situation. Had like three paragraphs explaining it but it's easier just to delete it and put in italics ""*It's Cmplicated.*""",cop5efc,opiates,1424263526,ToEndAllHabits,1,0

The new direction and purpose motivated me to quit the weed and get a job (albeit a shit one at McDonalds) but I had something to look forward to and work towards so I can content and set.


After nailing my college course and getting together with my first girlfriend, in summer 2012 I was on top of the fucking world.


Weed free, in work, with a girl I loved, having great sex on the reg and about to go to Uni, everything was in front of me.


Then I got to Uni and it was nothing like what I had expected/hoped.
The strain of distance put the kibosh on my relationship and a bunch of beurocratic shit meant I couldn't do my teacher training even after I finished my degree.


Then I got totally disillusioned with school (especially since and English degree is essentially worthless unless you're going on to be an English teacher), my mum got cancer and my Aunt drank herself to death all within a month and the next thing I know I'm on the Horse. chasing away my shattered dreams and troubled heart.


Now I'm tanking my last year of Uni that I worked so hard to get to, desparately looking for anyt kind of shitty bar-type job that'll have me so that at least if I'm to spend my life doing some garbage job I've no passion for it'll be in a city where shit's going on, there's always something to do or bands to see, I don't have to constantly run in to people I went to school with or relatives I don't want anything to do with and I'm not around to actively disappoint my mum.",cofouag,opiates,1423456455,CodeineMartin,2,0

"Your story is familiar to me. All too familiar. I quit shooting speedballs in 1996 after many many gallons worth had been injected - some from puddles on rooftops some from worse sources. Sharpening overused needles with match packs. It's a hard hard hard life. Heroin addiction to those already in horrible pain from crazy childhoods, poverty and abuse is mercilessly enticing. Who is strong enough to turn down a quick and guaranteed respite from intense pain borne for decades without relief? Especially when one doesn't know of any other way to deal with pain?

In a sense, heroin tends to prevent fast and easy suicides, offering instead 'death on the installment plan'. Not many survive it and those who do are just plain lucky. I'm one of the few who lucked out and got away but that had little or nothing to do with insight or courage because I had none.

I too have lots of great stories about my 12-years of using and dealing to support my speedball habit and I'd write about them if I could remember any. 

One minor difference in our stories is that I hated dealers who *didn't* use or weren't junkies because that made selling heroin much more evil in my eyes. It's weird to me that you were hated for being a dealer *and* a junkie. Being a junkie was the only thing that made dealing seem morally acceptable in my mind.

Of course it wasn't morally acceptable and I was fooling myself.

Congratulations for escaping and thanks for sharing your story with such honesty and absolute realness. I hope a lot of people now struggling with addiction will be inspired by your post and look into alternative lifestyles that cannot fail but lead to easier, happier lives. Anyone can do it as long as they give up stubbornly refusing to suffer.

Junkies are control freaks who feel they must micromanage their moods every hour of the day from the second they get up in the late afternoon until they pass out, along with other vampires, in the pre-dawn morning. They are not willing to surrender to the enormity of their temporarily concealed pain. They feel compelled to fight it tooth and nail; to put it off indefinitely if possible.

In order to quit, one must decide, ""OK I will suffer and then I'll learn to live an easier, happier life whatever it takes"". Those who are unwilling to surrender control of their moods night and day have a much harder time and most don't make it. There but for the grace of god go I (even for atheists like me).",coywi38,opiates,1425045258,Pongpianskul,2,0

"&gt; I do agree though if you are shooting pills the binders can be just as dangerous as heroin cuts

That's just misinformation. Shooting pill binders is **way** worse for you than shooting heroin, unless your heroin is 10% purity and cut by a homicidal lunatic who wants to kill his costumers. You're severely underestimating the dangers of shooting binders. A tablet of oxy/whatever is almost entirely filler.

Heroin bulking agents are usually harmless because *killing your customer is bad business*. And inactive, harmless white powders are significantly cheaper than actual drugs or dangerous chemicals. Cutting your heroin with lactose is a lot cheaper than cutting it with ground up benadryl or rat poison or whatever you're imagining that dealers mix their dope with.

And as long as we're talking about black market drugs: You can't even be sure that your pills are genuine unless you're getting them straight from the pharmacy yourself.

"Get some DXM powder and theracurmin (or curcumin but theracurmins formula is best) if you have the money. These 2 literally reverse tolerance and thus addiction, there's studies online with evidence, and you can take them with loperamide relatively safely. There's also threads on here where people tested it with very good results, search curcumin in this sub.     

Honestly if you can get these it will help SO MUCH. I'm not sure if you can combo them with gaba and xanax but they may work better anyway, if you can combo them then that's one hell of a cocktail but probably the closest to a complete cure we have. Keep the doses of both smallish, around 70-90mg DXM and (i think) 1 gram theracurmin once or twice a day, try not to take more but you can I guess.     

(Note: theracurmin taken in high does with opiates may be neurotoxic but I'm not sure if lope counts, it probably doesn't so higher doses might be fine as long as you don't relapse and take both together. Also taking high doses of DXM daily is very bad but at these small doses and only for a week it shouldn't be a problem.)  ",cor38g4,opiates,1424401268,Rantnonsense,1,0

I hate to ask this, but are you sure you aren't maybe changing this story around a little bit, and maybe you or someone was stealing them, and THAT'S why they won't stock them anymore? Because I know that happens, I've seen stores start keeping them at the service desk counter, or stop stocking them because they're losing money on them.

Not trying to accuse you, just asking an honest question, and if you were, no judgment from me whatsoever, I've done it before and I learned I was just shooting myself in the foot because they don't restock them as quickly if you steal them, and eventually if you keep doing it they won't stock them at all.

"Not longterm, at least I haven't been able to. I used to get a monthly script for migraines, but doctor cut me off and put me on Imitrex. Imitrex gets rid of the migraine pain but leaves the out-of-it feeling and makes my upper body hurt and feel really weak. Dr offered to switch me to a diff migraine specific med, but it pissed me off because I KNOW opiates work. I was doing that with no problems (not using daily) for awhile. It wasn't until I had other pain issues that I became addicted. 

ER here used to give morphine IV for migraines but now that give stupid fucking toradol, anti-nausea meds, and enough benadryl (to counteract anxiety from the anti-nausea meds) to knock me out into the following day. 

Only opiates completely got rid of the migraine pain and mental fog/weirdness. With the other remedies I'm not in severe pain but still can't function. Sucks. If you have an older doc you might be able to get a narcotics script for migraines. That's my next plan is to find a new primary care who is near elderly.",co8gay5,opiates,1422853497,wildthrift,1,0

"Well, I don't know if the backstory is all that interesting.  I'm an IT consultant, and my clients all own businesses.  I don't know if it is the IT aspect of my job, or being in New York City where things are a bit less conservative, or both, but I have established relationships with all of my clients.  I more or less know all their stories, their families in many cases, and all the other sketchy shit an IT person would notice or read about having access to everything.

Many clients offer me a drink or a bong hit when I go to their houses or offices.  Everyone is fairly open about smoking pot around here.  Everyone does it. I don't really know anyone (except for some of the family people) who doesn't out of all my clients.

While all of these clients begin with their businesses, as they've gotten to know me, they ask if I'll help with their home shit.  Being in the city, no one lives that far from where I live or work, or where they live or work.  

This client in particular lives very close to me.  I fixed some home issue he had at some point.  He had an old bottle of quaaludes, believe it or not.  It's an original bottle from years ago that he bought with actual quaaludes in it.  It's wild. 

That brought up the topic of opiates and I mentioned CWE, which he was interested in.  So we FaceTimed, and I thought the combination of his fancy kitchen, the bottle with the torn off label, and his 'Heroes of the Torah' glass was really funny.  So I took the screenshot.

That's pretty much the story.  Every so often I go over to his house and we play backgammon and smoke pot.  He's a cool guy, more than twice my age.  He listens to downtempo music in his ridiculously well designed apartment with a great view of a bridge.  It's a super chill environment to do drugs and listen to music.

but he disrespected you by bringing up past things, he in my opinion from a mans perspective brought those things up to hurt you, probably the way he felt hurt(stupid but it happens).

trust is key, try to build more of it, cut the ex totally out of your life, block em whatever it takes to prove trust with the person your with.  i feel for the abuse aspect and again I feel it was wrong he disrespected you.

"There are those of us who have never ""put anyone on"" - in fact, purposely keeping it away from non-using friends, even denying them the opportunity when they express the curiosity to try ""it"". 

In fact, I can fathom that many ""in the closet"" addicts are equally as secretive about their habits for non-selfish reasons as they are for selfish ones. 
They harbor great pain in their addictions; they go through trials and tribulations that shatter the entirety of one's being, enduring the torture that addiction brings to their physical health as well as tearing their mental and emotional faculties asunder. 

The psychological weight of keeping all of that bottled up manifests in countless ways; maybe, just maybe, some of them hide, living a life of secrecy and quiet suffering, for reasons other than to keep up appearances. Consciously or unconsciously.

They don't want to see another friend or loved one walk down that insidious road, that maddening mobius strip of blind repetition and dark destiny that addiction tends to invoke. Stumbling through the endless cycle of using, getting clean and relapsing; one day they wake up, open their eyes and for the very first time, in the same moment as their very first conscious breath - find themselves surrounded by a foul air - and with the next, that their chests are leaden... now bearing the weight of the once-foreign, now all too-familiar internal clock - a daily *(depending on the severity of use, hourly)* countdown to doom and despair... tirelessly *tick-tick-ticking* away - faster and faster &amp; louder and louder until, given long enough, the ticks become a desperate ocean of broken voices, impulses, delusions, lies, and false-promises. 
Some are pitiful, many are angry. The voice of reason is all but submerged, barely detectable within the tempest. The cacophonous freak-circus show that is the mind during peak withdrawal is quite the experience. Driven to near-madness, the will breaks &amp; the body obeys. *Obtaining La Cura* becomes reason to exist. Now all you have to do is just push the plunger to make the deranged carnival music stop &amp; the thousand headed monkeys crashing cymbals in the brainbox fade away, like some sweat soaked Miyazaki dream. The timer is reset - but the numbers just got worse. A manic, egoistic victory .... at quite some expense to everything else that comprises the holistic human being.

When that happens, there comes a climax, a crossroad of sorts. In one direction: death, and the end of one life story. Conversely, when the addict manages to survive the ordeal, there is a revelation. The veneer falls. The veil is lifted, the dog and pony show is done. The Secret is brought out in plain view for all to see.

Some are shocked, some indignant; others angry, and indifferent. 

What does one life matter?

The Eulogy of an addict is a complex one. 

Are all a villainous, selfish and reckless lot?

We all have the capacity for great good and great evil. Some, who bear their pain in silence, harbor and try to contain their darkness for fear that it would devour &amp; extinguish anothers light. Surely, some are too deep gone at that particular point in their life-timeline and fail to see beyond the fog of their own, self-imposed misery. But many do not go down that road.

"It might be. It just depends on how it affects you. Make sure you drink plenty of water when you dose though. It might also help to take stool softeners when you take lope if it stops you up really good. Lope also can take a while to fully kick in. Don't redose again for at least an hour, preferably even two just to be sure that it is fully working. It wouldn't have kicked in all the way after only 20 minutes. You want to try and take as little as you need to keep the withdrawals at bay. Once you know how much you need, you can dose it all at once once or twice a day (depending on how it affects you. A lot of people only need to dose once a day to be good and some need to dose twice.)

Edit: if you ever use these to kick completely and not just for ""in between"" days, take your full dose for 2-4 days and then start to gradually lower the dose over the next 3-7 -ish days or so and you should be good. 

It also doesn't matter if you dose on a full or empty stomach as you aren't using them to get high or anything.

"In terms of a rush,  I'd say opana was the closest to dope. It's not prickly and painful like dilaudid and morphine were for me. 

 In terms of the drawn out part of the high, or legs,  I would say oxycodone was the closest. It gives me a nice energy and euphoria kind of like heroin does (for me), but the rush from oxycodone, while pleasant, was never as intense as a good dope rush. 

If they made a pill with the rush of opana and the legs of oxycodone then, in my opinion, it would be very close to the h experience. 

I'm speaking in terms of ecp(iv). Tar and #3 will have a somewhat different effect. 

Everyone seems to have a different opinion on this, as I've heard some say that dilaudid (injected) is very close to dope. They are all great in their own way, but no pill I've had is better than dope. 

Edit: since you don't shoot, I'm gonna b say that oxycodone will be the best bet, most akin to dope, pill.  I've not snorted opana though, so i can't speak on it.  Dilaudid never did much for me when I snorted it. Neither did morphine. ",col0qwl,opiates,1423889351,throwawaydrugtest95,5,0

"My best advice is to eat a very fatty meal before your dose. I ain't talking a bowl of lard 5 minutes before your dose up, but maybe a bowl of ice cream or some chocolate about half an hour before. 

For example, last night before work, I drank a cwe, but had a lasagna about 5 minutes after. The high, for me, was about 1/10 as strong but last about 10x longer. Like, if a high is a ball of play-dough, a ball would be your instant release on an empty stomach, and if you pressed on the ball and made it flat, that would be like your meal high. 

Go somewhere between lasagna before work and empty stomach in the morning. Eat a chocolate bar or two, and half an hour later, take an antacid and dose up! Helps that I too used codeine last night, so this applies to you. 

Need any more advice, PM me! I used codeine alone for about 4 years so I know a few tips and tricks when it comes to dosing up and squeezing all that goodness out! 

EDIT- think of this like this, a high is 10 points. 5 of those is the legs (duration), the other 5 is intensity. If you make the intensity 6, your duration becomes 4. If your make your duration 6, the intensity becomes 4. Following? 

EDIT 2 (lol) - unless you take more opiates. Then you have 20 points to play with. Taking more doesn't increase one side of the ratio, it just multiplies the whole thing. 10 points for 300mg of codeine, 20 points for 600mg ect. Obviously this is NOT an exact science im just putting it in an easy to understand analogy because I'm good at doing that. Hope it helps! ",col63ir,opiates,1423910528,Grateful_Live420-,3,0

"I've done hundreds of cotton shots and never once had cotton fever. I've never bothered with freezing them either, but it is absolutely essential that they are left out in a well ventilated area with minimal dust to completely dry. If I was ever not 100% sure it was completely dry then I would leave it for another couple hours just so I can be 100% sure, all it takes is the minutest drop of water to start the growth of nasty bacteria.


After I would transfer the cotton to a sterile container with all the other dry cottons and then once I'm inevitably out of opiates I would do a wash on some of the old cottons by pulling the plunger out of a rig and stuffing them down the barrel and then adding some water to soak all the cottons. I would put the plunger back in carefully as not to displace the water and let it soak for 5-10 min. Once sufficiently soaked all that was left to do is push the plunger down to get all the water out of the cottons into a spoon. The resulting liquid would be virtually clear but I still liked to filter it again albeit with a very tiny piece of filter.


Back in my hayday I was shooting H, morphine and oxycodone on the regular so most of the time when I did a wash I was getting a bit of all 3 opiates which led to some awesome highs. Sometimes I was actually looking forward to being dry just so I could get in on some of that trifecta opiate bliss hah also id occasionally go on meth binges as well so there was sometimes a bit of meth in my wash shot which made things interesting to say the least.


But yeah in summary the key to not getting cotton fever is to make sure they're 100% dry. Its still possible that some bacteria is transferred from your hands to cottons but the point at which most people go wrong is that they don't sufficiently dry the cottons in the first place or they are going dumpster diving in their trash can.",co88ugl,opiates,1422839334,ascan_nerdarkly,5,0

"Others have answered you on the Adderall thing, but when pain patients take opiates for pain at a normal dosage, they're not necessarily getting high at all. It just works to relieve their pain. I had a coworker who was prescribed 5 mg Vicodin for heart pain and took it daily for years. He said he never got high from it, it just helped his pain. If my back goes out or I have a really bad cough from bronchitis, I take 5 mg Vicodin pills or cough syrup every day for about a week. It helps my pain and cough, but I don't get high. I have to take a higher dosage to get high. Opiates can work differently on people with pain as opposed to people just taking them to get high. And when you are taking opiates for long term pain, you may develop a natural tolerance over months of use, but actual addiction is quite rare, according to experts.

I'm not naive nor am I stupid and I would never say that you can't get addicted to something or high from something just because it's ""medicine.""

 Same shit happened to me,  it felt like overnight.  

 One day I'm nodding from 3 bags 2 days later I'm shooting a bundle and all I get is medium rush,  shit tone of immediate quickly passing itchiness and the absence of high,  instead of high I would get anxiety as if I just did coke.

 The scary part of that happening is that you can no longer detox with suboxone.  I made a post a year ago or so about my experience,  but to summ it up : I tried detoxing around 18 times over 1.5 month.  Every time I waited at least 24 hours and until I was puking like a machine,  I was chocking on my own vomit because it kept coming and gag reflex wouldn't stop,  anxiety to the point of it feeling like a seizure and permanent huge goose bumps,  repetative non stop Orgasm for hours every 15 seconds (I counted)  and buckets of sweat + the highest score on C. O. W. chart.  Longest I tried waiting was 48 or 52 hours after last shot.  And EVERY single time,  I went into Percipitated withdrawal.  No matter how sick I was prior or how long I waited.


  The last detox attempt with PWD I couldn't get ahold of any of my dealers to get H to reset the buprenorphine in my system.  I tried for 5 hours and gave up,  called ER. They brought me into NYC Beth Israel,  that was in 2011. 
 I have never in my life felt such fear,  anxiety,  pain,  embarrassment and helplessness,  I kept begging them to put me under anesthesia,  they didn't know what to do,  kept giving me benzos,  clonidine,  muscle relaxers,  valium etc and it didn't get any better. Doctors where clueless,  suboxone wasn't as known yet. 


 Next thing I remeber is ,  6 hours later when they finally made a decision on what to do with me,they shot me up with 20 mgs of Methadone,  which immediately made it 49% worse,and then I must have passed out from pain and exhaustion because, the next thing I remeber is them wheeling me in one of those handicap wheelchairs into Beth Israel detox fascility.  They started me on methadone.  


 And as much as people talked shit about it,  due to which I never considered that option,  it sure as hell saved my life and gave me a second chance.  Tapering of methadone 3 years later was actually very smooth and easy.  Those who say it's hell are people who rush the taper or drop too large of dosages.  I tapered down to 2 mg and now switched to subs in August and Tapering off them,  should be done by March.

"Preview:

The information provided in this eBook will aid in; preventing tolerance to Opiates, preventing withdrawal from Opiates, preventing neurotoxicity from Opiates and enhancing the effects of Opiates. I am not claiming your tolerance level will be reset to that of a non-Opiate user, but I am claiming it will make a significant difference, not only in regards to enhancing the effects of Opiates, but also on while you aren’t using, as the lack of withdrawal allows you to live life more freely. The information in this eBook is not set in stone; everyone has different reactions to drugs, use this information as an aid in experimenting, to find what works for you. P.S. if you find any mistakes, please inform me so I can correct them.

"That happened to me too! After 2 years of use I stopped feeling the high,  only th rush and then mad anxiety.  You can read it in details in my recent response to someone's post if you click on my history.  It's a very long response and hard to miss also posted twice,  since I first responded to wrong person. 

Nvm I'll copy paste it here,  thou that ops question was why he doesn't feel the high anymore but it seems to fit yours too : 

Same shit happened to me, it felt like overnight. 

One day I'm nodding from 3 bags 2 days later I'm shooting a bundle and all I get is medium rush, shit tone of immediate quickly passing itchiness and the absence of high, instead of high I would get anxiety as if I just did coke. I would get a high once in a while, but only 1 out of 10 times. 

That phenomenon kept me in shock and denial for weeks. I even bought same bundles for friends with same tolerance to see how their bodies react and they where out from 2 to 4 bags, I used up to 7 bundles a day by that point. Until I finally realized, my tolerance sky rocketed overnight and my brain simply doesn't react to the drug the same any longer. 

The scary part of that happening is that you can no longer detox with suboxone. I made a post a year ago or so about my experience, but to summ it up : I tried detoxing around 18 times over 1.5 month. Every time I waited at least 24 hours and until I was puking like a machine, I was chocking on my own vomit because it kept coming and gag reflex wouldn't stop, anxiety to the point of it feeling like a seizure and permanent huge goose bumps, repetative non stop Orgasm for hours every 15 seconds (I counted) and buckets of sweat + the highest score on C. O. W. chart. Longest I tried waiting was 48 or 52 hours after last shot. And EVERY single time, I went into Percipitated withdrawal. No matter how sick I was prior or how long I waited.

The last detox attempt with PWD I couldn't get ahold of any of my dealers to get H to reset the buprenorphine in my system. I tried for 5 hours and gave up, called ER. They brought me into NYC Beth Israel, that was in 2011. I have never in my life felt such fear, anxiety, pain, embarrassment and helplessness, I kept begging them to put me under anesthesia, they didn't know what to do, kept giving me benzos, clonidine, muscle relaxers, valium etc and it didn't get any better. Doctors where clueless, suboxone wasn't as known yet. 

Next thing I remeber is , 6 hours later when they finally made a decision on what to do with me,they shot me up with 20 mgs of Methadone, which immediately made it 49% worse,and then I must have passed out from pain and exhaustion because, the next thing I remeber is them wheeling me in one of those handicap wheelchairs into Beth Israel detox fascility. They started me on methadone. 

And as much as people talked shit about it, due to which I never considered that option, it sure as hell saved my life and gave me a second chance. Tapering of methadone 3 years later was actually very smooth and easy. Those who say it's hell are people who rush the taper or drop too large of dosages. I tapered down to 2 mg and now switched to subs in August and Tapering off them, should be done by March. 

Anyways, long story but maybe it will help someone. 

Our brain's neurons and dopamine receptors have a limit, once you cross it, they ""break"" , and the only cure from that is treatment and recovery.

1) If you want a drug to sniff or shoot, there is a great one available it's cheap and everywhere. Furthermore, the dangers of H are vastly overstated. As long as you do a small test bit every time and never mix it with benzos or alcohol, it no more dangerous than prescription drugs.


2) Someone once gave me some tamper resistant OP80s. ""Dang"", I thought, these things suck, right? I mean with all the people trying to circumvent the tamper resistance, these must be worthless. Anyway, I just popped one anyway to see if I could get any buzz. To my surprise, what followed was a very nice, rolling warm high that was perfectly euphoric.

"I'm so glad I got that post wrong about your hubby Kitten. Maybe you could look into kratom for ye fella. I only know it from this sub but sounds ^ something very could very well benefit from . It's also legal. 

Another that comes to mind is PST. Poppy seed tea. Again all I know is from this forum but apparently it's good at pain relive, is obviously opiate based.  It can be lightly addictive.

Hope you have luck finding a new doc. By the sounds of it you need one. Read up about methadone for pain relief . It's starting to gain traction because it's as strong if not stronger than morphine for relief. It's cheaper than pills for pain (this possibly pisses off Big Pharma) and although it's just as addictive it doesn't really have the potential for abuse as you don't get any high from it.

I know that there are doctors in America prescribing it for pain relief.  Do your research. And if I was you I'd tell me doctor your afraid of getting addicted to pills and would ^ to try the methadone for pain.  Tell him you know it is as addictive but has less of abuse potential. And doesn't leave you groggy or stoned.

"I'm with ya! I found out in June of last year I had a massively herniated disc in L4-L5 so surgery it was. Two weeks post op, still had severe pain. Went back to surgeon, it reherniated. Repeat surgery and MRI, to find out I have degenerative disc disease &amp; L4-S1 is completely calcified with bone spurs. August 23 had L4-S1 fusion.
I've been where you are. Since its prescribed and what you're saying, you have a dependence to hydrocodone. I was on quite the buffet last year. At one point I was on 160mg/day of oxycodone, hydromorphone, fentanyl, Valium and vistaril. I'm now down to 20mg/day of oxy and I feel so much better. If you're not having surgery try to get off the norco. The past few months have been absolute hell with the withdrawals and initially feeling like total crap, but now I feel so different. Doctors, especially spine surgeons, know when someone is actually in pain or they just want a script. I work in the medical field and see this all the time. I went through absolute hell and never want to go through that again.

"I kind of see myself as some what of a dilly guru. I get a prescription every two weeks, I go through it in a week, then take a week off. I have been doing this for almost a year now. So the rush is great and if your tough the wds aren't bad, if you're just using it this once no need to worry about that. I iv 4mg 5-10 times a day when using and I'd say 80-100mg of oxy gets me. So I'd say try 2mg first then wait a bit just incase then 2 more. I learned to shoot myself but I have extensive knowledge/time spent In hospitals and 1000+  needle sticks so I hit the second time, and had the knowledge of what dosage wouldn't kill me. The rush is quick and during that time is when most people fall out. If you are alone I highly suggest naloxone. While I wouldn't suggest the needle your gonna do what your gonna do. I sometimes still swollen them and sometimes still snort them if I want it to last longer. if your using it consistently you'll have a bad 24-48 hr withdrawal due to its quick half life. For me it's like 24 hours and then with a few days of 20mg of lope I'm fine and functional. Also dilaudid is soluble in room temp water, so crush mix and draw through wheel filter or cotton.

"I like NeilMed sinus rinse bottles. They're at CVS, Duane Reade, Rite Aid, whatever. Similar to a Neti Pot but I find that they're more effective. The package you buy comes with a bottle and saline packets, so you just need to fill the bottle with filtered water each time and you're set. I've had messed up sinuses for my entire life even before my drug days and I swear by doing these rinses as often as possible. I've been clean for quite some time and still make a point of rinsing regularly just because it makes a remarkable difference for my breathing and comfort to have clean sinuses.

Try to do the rinse before you start sniffing for the day and when you're done for the night before you sleep...although if you're doing a bundle a day, I guess your start and finish points might not be too terribly clear cut.

Get your hands on some shea butter as well, and put it below your nose where it gets chapped and inside the nostril as well. Shea butter is a miracle, no joke.

EDIT: I'm sure you're well aware of this, but my conscience couldn't let it go unsaid...harm reduction on your nose/sinuses is really important, man. You don't wanna fuck those up, because problems in those areas can lead to persistent misery. Your nose is your main filtration system on the way to your lungs, and sinus issues can lead to chronic headaches, hearing issues, tinnitus, and, something I've had a lot of experience with and wouldn't wish on anyone: eustachian tube dysfunction. Whether you opt for a Neti Pot or the NeilMed sinus rinse that I suggested, make rinsing your sinuses into a habit. I'd advocate it for anyone, but especially for anyone who puts drugs up their nose. You don't want permanently fucked up sinuses from this stuff.",comutv9,opiates,1424067644,mt923,2,0

"I started out with codeine after breaking my hand and being prescribed 56x 30mg pills post surgery. I'd never even heard of it before and it took a google search of the drug to realise it could be used recreationally which I decided to try out. I was in the military at the time and to avoid being kicked out due to failing a drug test I, generally, only drank alcohol so it was a welcome addition to my legal drug inventory (here in the UK it's available OTC as well). I began using it more and more often and began performing CWEs in order to extract the miniscule amount of codeine out of the OTC pills which also contained paracetamol. 

Now I'm a full blown IV heroin addict with two ODs and two hospital admissions in two consecutive days last week, something which I would never have believed the first time I used codeine (or the 100th time for that matter). The point I am trying to make out is that many of us here started with something as ""inconsequential"" as codeine, believing that we would never touch anything harder, we especially vehemently denied any possibility of us picking up a needle. It might not be something you do for months or even years but I, for one, unknowingly and slowly chipped away at the mental barriers I had built from seeing the destruction heroin can cause, first hand. Just be careful of any future experiments you do with codeine. When I began using it more often I would not eat before taking codeine and would get drunk beforehand, this resulted in the high being 10x stronger and more enjoyable which in turn led to it being 10x harder to stop doing for any long period of time. Don't dismiss the addictive power of codeine either.

"[drunk phone posting - sorry in advance for the screwups I'm sure there will be]  

I've been with my bf for going on 5yrs total. Our relationship started out because of drugs, pills to be exact, and has been in the center of it the whole time. It's been better than most of my relationships I think cuz he gets it sometimes where other guys wouldn't. Like when I'm being particularly bitchy he knows it's prolly just WD and doesn't take it so personally... little things like that.  

that's not to say it's perfect tho. We started off  splitting everything equally, but somewhere along the line my tolerance skyrocketed while his remained the same  (also proving size means squat cuz I'm 5'3 and he's a good 6'4!). I'd be SO resentful that he could get messed up off a fraction of what I needed! Sounds stupid but is what it is. Little things like that.  

So that led to my many a side (ex. my friend religiously fronts me 15 p10s 2x/ a month... we pay him back $150... or so bf thinks. Really I pay him back $200 and he's giving me 30, not 15.) I always spend my own money on these, but I still feel like an ass for lying, by omission anyways, so that causes problems. More little things.

They all add up. I can say things, aside from my (and maybe his, I dunno) side deals we have a really otherwise straight forward relationship like I haven't had w/ many dudes. His ex wife was pretty heinous so I'd have to be a pretty bad fuck up for the damn to hate me. We both have had the same job for around 20 yrs, productive members of society sorta, and keep to ourselves.

"That totally makes sense. Lying about being in w/d to get more drugs is not OK. I've lied to and stolen from my partner so I get it though. It's easier to say you're in w/d than to admit that you just 'need' more. 

Sounds a bit out of control if he is nodding at dinner. I assume you've asked him not to get that wrecked before dates, etc. And forgetting about you once he's high is a red flag. 

I don't think it's fair to say that H makes him happier than you ever will. Maybe the drugs make him more comfortable around you. Also, men (in my experience) tend to like having their girl around even if they aren't interacting much. So maybe he doesn't realize that you are unsatisfied. 

Sounds like you just need to have a serious chat - I'd recommend approaching him when he isn't in w/d but also isn't nodding off obviously. I realize that might be hard. But that's probably when he will be the most honest and not just telling you what you want to hear, IMO. Good luck! I personally use more therapeutically - to calm my pain and anxiety, but not to get super/visibly high, so I probably don't have as much insight as others on this sub. 

If nothing else, I think that being firm about not paying for his habit would be a good start. Like I said, you can pick him up comfort meds and be there for him, but he can buy his own H unless you are planning to use together.

I read a scientific study on oxycodone 30mg IR (blues) which stated that within the control group only like 7% experienced withdrawal symptoms after 6 months of uninterrupted daily use. I really think the wd symptoms are way more mental than we actually believe. A major factor that reinforces my opinion is the anecdote about ayahuasca treatment for addiction. Apparently there is a ayahuasca treatment center for addiction in Peru. If I recall correctly, the people were given 3 doses of ayahuasca over a 2 day period and after it wore off the participants had no wd symptoms at all and had no desire to do any more dope. It was a pretty cool watch n worth checking out its on YouTube. Just thought it was interesting the people were basically saying that the opiate demon was personified during their trip and they were able to chase away the demon and then when they cane down they were just fine.

A doctor she went to looked her straight in the eye and said ""You know what I think? I think you *need* this medication. In fact I think you need to be on something stronger. But I'm not going to give you anything. You know why? Because I can't *stand* Dr. XXX. Get out of my office.""

"Would love to know if these are a good brand to use.


Just a heads up - I used ""Food to Live"" brand off Amazon about 6 months ago, and I got Thebaine poisoning.  [Thebaine](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thebaine) is an opiate; but a stimulant, they use it to make hydrocodone I believe.  It is also a [convulsant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convulsant), and is pretty much poison.  

Basically, some poppy farmers breed their brand to have a high thebaine content, as it is used in the production of many of our pharmaceuticals.  But although it is an opiate and an upper, it is by far the worst experience of anything I have ever had, ever.  I felt so horrible, my heart rate was 160-170, I was sweating, nauseous, couldn't sit still, and couldn't do anything to distract myself from the way I was feeling.  I tried to ride it out, as I had made tea like this before.  But after a while, it kept getting worse until eventually I developed a pretty settled expectation that I was going to die.

I ended up taking some beta blocker medication I had lying around, and it stopped my heart from beating out of control.  Spent the rest of the night in the fetal position, sweating, and twitching.  I lost about 6 pounds throughout the night from sweating/retching.

"By ""titrating"" the dosage they would be adjusting it to compensate for your increase in tolerance. This could mean an increase in quantity of your current prescription (and daily alotted), or perhaps giving you a stronger version (raising the mg of your current script). This would likely work, but in the event that it doesn't they could prescribe a more effective painkiller such as oxycodone. But you want your doctor to make that decision, ofcourse. Asking for painkillers by name is likely the biggest red flag of all.

"Damn those are expensive scratch offs for an addict. When I used to cop I would spend like maybe 10 bucks on 1 or 2$ scratch offs, contuing to play until I either won over 20 or lost the original money. I got a bun for every 70 and if i had a bit extra I would spend it on these. I had never done anything scratch off or lottery related until that point and I definitely came out on top. I lost my money a few times but I also won 150 on a 1 or 2 scratch off once, and between 20 and 100 multiple times. Considering would never spend more than 20 bucks and doubled my money at least 1/3 of the time and broke even another third of the time, I certainly ended up ahead. Then I stopped completely. I've played a couple since and lost and now I just don't bother at all. Figure I should just quit while I'm ahead.

"I've tried it a few times and it seems like a potentiator at best; although it definitely seems like a nice tool to have laying around if you have to go through withdrawal. Even for people who like it, tolerance apparently skyrockets insanely fast for this drug, so from what I've read and understood, the most effective way to use it is every once in a while and in a big dose. Hope that helps! I'm interested to see what others say too because this drug definitely seems complex or at least unique because on paper it seems almost like a VERY VERY weak benzo/opioid combo in terms of its effects (although I've tried high doses and it does nothing for me from what I can tell). That, plus the weird, super nonlinear tolerance buildup, makes it interesting in theory at least. 

All that being said, I have done no research on pregbalin (lyrica), but from what I've read around here it seems like a straight-up better version of gabapentin.

"Maybe I can help put your mind at rest very slightly when it comes to your brother's OD. I OD'd twice last week (in two consecutive days), both times someone rang an ambulance and I had to spend time in the hospital's ""resuscitation"" unit. The first OD I was found straight away because my flat mate heard me smash my head off my TV stand as I fell backwards off my bed. He rang 999 straight away, they told him to perform CPR which he did until the ambulance crew arrived. They had to stick a curved tube with a large hole down my throat to open my airways and perform CPR through it as I wasn't breathing until they shot me with Naloxone which woke up.

The second time was similar although it was in the public toilets at a local mall. The only reason I was found was because my feet were practically sticking out under the cubicle door ( I must have slipped off the toilet slightly) and someone realised I was unresponsive and called the ambulance after breaking open the door. I awoke on the floor after being shot with naloxone again. My clothes were cut open and my nipple bar had been taken out so they could use the defibralator on me as my heart had stopped and I had stopped breathing. I can't believe I am still here.

Both of these times I can remember shooting up and nothing else as I had completely passed out right after removing the needle. I felt absolutely nothing, no struggle and certainly no pain. It was just likely any other black out when you pass out. I wouldn't say it was pleasant but it also certainly didn't feel unpleasant at the time.

"They are weaker (oxycodone[Percocet] is about 1.5 times stronger than hydrocodone [norco/vicodin]) however, it might help with your symptoms. Some people respond differently to both, so it's an option worth exploring if you can't figure out how to control the itchiness and nausea. He might just prescribe 7.5/325 or 10/325 hydrocodone pills instead if you go ahead and try these. 

Another thing that might be causing the nausea is the APAP (Tylenol/acitominophen) in the pills. If that was the case, or if Tylenol usually makes you nauseous, then plain 5mg instant release (roxicodone) pills might work well for you and might be something your doctor recommends you to try instead. 

Again, I would just bring it up with him and see what he says. (I would for sure tell him the pain relief is great and necessary, but the side effects are bothering you, you know?) Maybe try the benedryl first, but if that doesn't work, then definitely ask him what you can do. Benadryl can also help some people with nausea, so maybe that is all you really need, but who knows. He might also prescribe something like promethazine for your nausea instead of changing your pills. It just depends on what he thinks is best and what you two decide on together.

if the person's retort was ""it's not possible for me to get high in that 14 day period and maintain this level of bupe in my system every 14 days.....""

even if was technically possible, how big would the window to get high be? not long i assume, if it all it'd be like torturing yourself for almost two weeks just so you could maybe get high for a day or two, and still maintain normal levels of bupe in your urine every 14 days....which wouldn't make sense.



unless i'm wrong. is it not only possible, but worth it? that's kinda what i'm asking also.

* Here is another about how you don't think a 14 year old is under age.

I sniffed some percocet once as a teenager but it didn't do shit for me except make my face itchy, so I wasn't really digging opiates at that time. It's wierd now to remember how abstinent I was as a teen. Better dayz

How would you describe effects of opiates to marijuana smoker?

Similar to the first few times you smoke weed, but with no anxiety or paranoia. That's exactly how I felt the first time I smoked heroin. It was instantly seducing me, and I then used for about a month straight after before being caught and forced to stop for a long while. The first time feelings fade though and it just kinda becomes routine. Almost boring. It will always makes you feel better than sober though...

Do you use opiates on daily basis and if you do, how does it affect you?

Not daily per se. I've used daily for about the last month or so, which has been retarded of me and at this point I'm just staving off the withdrawals until I can get my benzo RC pillz in the mail and get a huge bottle of lope. Also got some sub which really helps. It affects me lately in that I spend a lot of time obtaining and doing it, and I have to lie to the people close to me about what I'm doing which makes me feel pretty lame. But I'd feel worse if they knew... Also $$$. It will disappear way too quick. Do NOT go hood rich and spend yr tax return and unemployment check on dope. That's where I lost.

Have opiates left negative/positive effects on your life?

They balance me out and make me not so butthurt all the time I guess, but I'd probably be a happier person if I didn't abuse opiates so regularly. Idk at this point. I've been using at LEAST once a week with some exceptions for the better part of a year. I've noticed (even high) my temper is pretty unstable and I'm a lot less good at maintaining and handling the shit that life throws at me. Usually if im high though I don't really concern myself with those things. Opi's have ruined many a night of sexual intercourse for me though, as my partner doesn't even get wet on them. Maybe I just suck at foreplay and intercourse. Who knows. They definitely haven't done me any real favors. When I'm high though it all feels worth it.

How heavy are withdrawal symptoms upon trying to quit?

I haven't gotten horrible withdrawals yet. Last time, it was uncomfortable enough for me to instantly grab some dope upon getting money, but I probably would have done that anyway. I just get really angry/depressed, uncomfortable, slightly sore, and shit my guts out a quarter of the time. Last time I withdrawed my eyes were very sensitive to light, which sucks if you have to cop dope 30 minutes away in the blaring sun like I had to.

If someone would say that he wants to try opiates, what would be your advice to him?

Stay away. Don't be a fool. THESE are the drugs that will ruin your whole shit. And if you decide to go seek them out anyway, go through me and break me off a little piece :p Just kidding, but if you decide to take the plunge (not IV necessarily but pun intended) please just do yr research and avoid any situation that your gut does not agree with. Because abusing opiates is eventually gonna take you into some pretty sketchy situations.

"No, you should be fine. When you're first infected with HCV, its called the ""acute stage' of infection. The viral load can be crazy high (in the millions) and one of your liver function tests (ALTs), could also get really high. There will be a lot of inflammation of the liver, and some people may feel sick (flu-like symptoms like nausea and fatigue), but theres no permanent damage done.

Since we're on the subject: You can get re-infected with HCV. And heavy alcohol use can increase the likelihood of HCV becoming chronic. So, do what you need to do to stay HCV negative (ie, no virus) by keeping other people's blood out of you if you inject or snort drugs.

"Okay so I met this girl when I was looking for some h and she was pretty cute in that strung out street kid sort of way. You know what I'm talking about. We grab some h off her dude and she asks if I know anywhere good to fix, and I'm like yeah I live like two blocks away from here. We grab a couple forties on the way back. We get to my place (I was living with my sister, her boyfriend and my boss at the time) and the girl does a shot, I'm smoking a foil and drinking a 40. She starts hitting some tweak and I take a couple puffs and promptly forget about my h. So I'm like 2.5 40's deep with a bunch of tweak in my system with a cute street girl in my tiny closet/bedroom, what else are we gonna do but fuck? We decide to go smoke a cigarette on the porch/balcony and nobody's home so I just grab my sheets. We're outside and I see my sister pull into the driveway, I tell the girl to be cool about the dope around my sister and another car I don't recognize pulls into the driveway. The driveway was shared between four units so I didn't think too much about it. My sister sees me on the porch and yells that our landlord is here, so I stand up and drunkenly knock the half drank forty off the porch and it smashes on the sidewalk in front of the house. So here I am, trying to cover both myself and this girl in a single sheet, while my landlord asks my sister if I'm gonna clean up the broken glass in front of the house and who comes home but my boss with like 6 of my coworkers so they all get to witness the shitshow that I am when I drink and smoke tweak. I fail at keeping the sheet around me as I put out my cigarette and try to get inside to put away all the paraphenalia in my room (for some reason there is a fuse box in the closet I was sleeping in). So there I am standing fully nude on a second floor porch in front of my sister, my boss, my coworkers and my landlord with a broken 40 on the ground and this girl who I now realize is not as cute as I thought she was when I was sick and she said she could get dope and who is also way dirtier and homeless looking than I realized. Apparently that warrants me being called dirty dan but I don't fucking see it.

I'm so FUCKING HAPPY.  i use to lift weights until i hurt my shoulder. managed to lift today and i honestly really love the natural high. i never thought I could do it. quit H. i don't know if this is a good thing but i caught myself thinking when like 10 mg of hydro/oxy use to get me high all fucking day. i can't wait till i have a few months sobriety under my belt and more stable life style. plus my new job will be eating a lot of my time. where i'll be able to  do that again. this isn't my first time quitting opiates. but it wasn't H before. just oxy/hydro. the last time was for a much longer period of use. last time was a year of use. compared to this 2-3 month binge of H? i'm starting to remember the things that would help me the first time I quit. sorry for the rambling.LOL hope everything is going well with ur withdrawals!

"Props to you for getting informed on the topic. You have come to the right place. I'll answer your questions as best as I can. On my phone. So kinda hard to go back &amp;amp; forth.   
I stumbled I to this life ever so innocently. Despite having been prescribed opiates on numerous occasions after many surgeries, about 7 or so, I rarely used them recreationally...even though I was big into weed, coke, benzos,  hallucinations, booze. It wasn't until about 24(42 now) when a friend bestowed upon my a glorious 30mg oxy that I thought, where have you been all my life. I never looked back.    
Without writing a book, I strongly encourage you to never go there. For all it's warmth and beauty, it is a beast that you will never shake. My addiction consumes me. Day in day out....looking for that never lasting love.      
Simply scroll through all of the posts on this sub, and it won't take long to see. our best days are ones when we are not sick, the big score, happy nods. Most people on this sub would do anything for a stranger...the most thoughtful, selfless, caring individuals you will ever meet, but WD's are painful and powerful...something you wouldn't wish on your worst foe.    
Trust me, there is no glamor in being an opiate addict, and the odds of getting clean are slim. We are called junkies, thieves, &amp;amp; losers.     
I could go on &amp;amp; on. I beg of you...don't taste the forbidden fruit.    
Edit-if I had the chance, I would never had self medicated with opiates. It's just not worth it in the long run.

     I've been dating an incredible girl since September, she knew of my past and my using subs. What she didn't know was I recently relapsed and was using about a gram a day for the last month. I was to afraid to tell her and full of shame, but I was ruining the relationship with my sneaking aroud, lies, and lack of sex drive. I broke down and told her cause I was sick of waking up sick everyday and sick of not being able to connect with her because I was bottling my life up away from her and thst was all I could think of. 

I hurt her and that was devastating for me something I'll never forgive myself for because I've always stressed honesty and open communication in our relationship and I broke her trust. She's still with me though she gets why I might use but she just cares about me and my well being. I'm 2 days on sub now but since telling her our relationship has been amazing, seriously despite feeling like shit have never felt so connected and happy.

I didn't clean for her, I know that would never work. but it was a major factor in my desire to straighten up... for me she honestly is more important than opiates.

"I'm sorry you're in such a bad mood. I only wish maybe you would think before posting an acidic reply like this to a person who is just trying to help by disseminating fairly reliable/accepted info about the topic. Like you said....you could have saved the time it took to type out two angsty paragraphs by simply copying and pasting the relevant info from the post you're hyping. 

There is no harm to over-spreading harm reduction info, so that is why people repeat so much, even the obvious shit. I'm sorry it bugs you (as repetitive shit tends to do), but of all the things in the world, it's really not doing anything to make anyone else's situation worse. I'm a counselor at a methadone clinic and the number of clients I have who rely on personal experience/hearsay without any sort of google-fu to check out clinical research is a serious reality check every day..... People who have been dosing for decades, yet are totally out of the loop with bupe basics. I get some crazy fucking questions that might seem totally idiotic/obvious to a well-researched person, but as the world is made up of people with many levels of knowledge or access to new knowledge, we can't just assume that because the information is *out there* that people know it. I mean, ffs, if I had a nickel for every time I told a person that our state allows clean rig sales at pharmacies and got a look of surprise, I would be able to buy a pack. but I digress. 

Some people try to help others by doing research, and gathering raw data. Some people try to help others by distributing safer IDU materials. Some people try to help others by sharing what they've learned. It would be nice if such well-known info such as ""the transition onto suboxone has a different timeline for different bodies"" had really, truly spread to all corners of the earth....but until it does, prepare to keep hearing the same info over and over and over again. Or, pretty similar info, as our understanding develops. 

Also....why is your, uh, revelation *actually useful in the real world* but nothing the OP submitted here is? Why would you get on someone about not copy/pasting the core info into their post and then turn around and link to a different page while not copy/pasting the info you wished to spread yourself? Why is your information not ""regurgitation""? Just...really trying to get a feel for all the hostility in your response.

"That's really sucks. My boyfriend and I were robbed at gun point by these two guys right after we bought some subway sandwiches at night. It was awful. We had my hydrocodone script for the month (stupid! After that I never kept my whole bottle with me) as well as like 800-1000mgs-ish of roxy pills (approx. $0.40/mg, so $320-400-ish worth) that we had just bought with the last of the only money I get for the month. We had just bought our only guy out for the next couple of days until he could re-up and it was a Friday night, meaning my doctor would not be in his office until Monday, so I couldn't get an early release from him for a new hydro script until then. It sucked a lot, but thankfully my boyfriend had forgotten to put my card that we had just used to buy the sandwiches with back in his wallet and they didn't find it while searching his pockets. This turned out to be a life saver as I got my financial aid money from school that day or the next or something and we were able to cop as soon as our guy was good again and on Monday I got a new bottle of my hydros as soon as my doctor was in his office. 

It's kind of funny now because they took my debit card (my financial aid money went to a different card) and apparently gave/sold the info to someone in New Mexico (I'm in CA.) I forgot to cancel it because I only had like $5 on it and you can't overdraw on it.

"Not to sound rude or bitchy but that is a really stupid plan. Like really really really stupid. Drugs are not worth throwing everything away for, at all. If you want to get clean get in a sub program. If you can manage to hide a heroin habit, hiding a sub program will stupid easy. It seems like besides the drugs you have a lot going for you and it would be really stupid to throw that all away because you are scared of what will happen if they find out, without knowing for sure thats even whats going to happen. I think that is the drugs talking not your rationale mind... I know my man gets what we call ""chicken little syndrome"" when he's using, he starts to freak out that the world is ending, our lives are over, everything is fucked beyond repair, etc when really nothing bad has happened or changed since when he was fine a few hours ago and by freaking out he's more likely to make all those bad things happen (when he gets like this he refuses to get out of bed and doesnt go to work or talk to anyone). I think that is what you are doing and if you step back and look at your situation its not all bad and you can make it right with doing just a little bit of work, a lot less work then it takes to continue being an addict or run away from your whole life.

"When I'm lost in the metaphorical dark and my phone is dead I find myself stumbling back into that warm embrace. It doesn't matter how many times I go detox or spend my time at summer camp nothing ever helps like the heating pad that is dope. It wraps you up in every way and for a split second suddenly all the bridges you burnt and friends you lost are okay. Everything is okay, it's not the euphoria that pulls you back in, (not that the rush from dilaudid isn't a bliss in itself) for me addiction is that simple. You flex your veins, you see the plume and then once again everything is okay all of the dark corners addiction has carried you through, again every fragmented bridge every burnt body is now acceptable your fears are gone and it's just OKAY. It isn't the rush, it isn't some chemical orgasm it's not that great, in the end it just numbs the pain of everything that lead you there in the first place. It makes it okay from your heels to your face when you see that plume you know that the stresses, regrets and anguish your addiction has brought you will disappear. And that's why it seems inescapable, the inherent synergy never stops. But it gives you a reason to get out of bed, to pay the man and wait again regretting every second of it until the perfect blanket of escape returns, and the high fades and you know there is only one way to return to your former self, to accept the mistakes and fear inherent in addiction.

"&gt;My heroin use is way down since I started using again after rehab compared to before I went to rehab, but even then, when I was doing a gram a day, if I got high in the morning I wouldn't get sick until the next day. 

That's weird. I don't use heroin (although I'd love to try) I wonder why the fuck I get sick so easily. 

&gt;In terms of other drugs losing their appeal, opiates have always been my one and only. I've only smoked pot once and didn't like it. Never drank much. Never done coke, though I would if I had an opportunity. I did meth for the first time tonight because my friend happened to stop by with some, and she's a big tweaker. It was okay, but I'll stick with my opiates. 

I used to be a big drinker but now I dont ever want to as it doesn't compare at all. Pot can be very wonderful for me but I don't really love the high. I use it for sleep, pain relief, and to get an appetite since adderall makes me not eat at all. I really don't like Xanax now I have like 55 of the peach Xanax and I'm giving half to my girl. Even then, aside from using for sleep or to help others I hate the high. I'll probably end up having some left over before my script is called in again. 

&gt;Basically, I never hung out with people who did drugs or drank a lot until after I went to rehab and made friends through treatment, and we eventually relapsed and started hanging out. Before I went to rehab I was totally isolated except for my daily runs to my dealer. 

The people I know absolutely love drugs. However they're either don't use enough to become addicted or use too much and end up robbing people and shit. A few of my buddies tried to get over on me.i paid one to clean my house and he had like 6 things in his pocket after I called him out on it he tried to fight me. That dude was like family to me.

"I've had a few docs who, when I mention researching stuff online, would be open to discussing what I had to say. These weren't pain docs, but psychiatrists actually, so pretty different but still MDs with script pads I guess...

Anyway, IME the ones with the most generous pens share one trait: it has been the ones who are open to discussion about what I, the patient, has seen online and learned myself, who are the best in terms of both treatment as well as prescribing *truly* helpful medication even if it is dependency-forming/high-risk-of-addiction. I think lots of docs are starting to struggle with a God complex of some sort: up until the last decade or so, they were the ones. They were the ones in our society who were certified to know **everything.** I was in middle school when wedMD became relatively popular for the first time. And now we can literally diagnose ourselves somewhat easily if the symptoms are obvious and exclusive 

So, I think when some doctors hear, ""Ya I was reading on the Internet that....____________,"" they're actually hearing something like ""so since I'm the smartest person in the world, I obviously went online and educated myself on a matter you worked toward your whole life, and now I know better than you."" And those doctors tend to dismiss patients, not believe them, believe they are in some sort of drug seeking conspiracy etc etc

But my best doctors, who all unfortunately at some point moved as they've all been professors as well, were the ones who also wanted to learn constantly, and were very interested to discuss new treatments and the latest research on stuff affecting me. Maybe it's like, they knew that I knew my own body, and was invested in its care? And were then so willing to be involved in collaborative care. After all, ""doctor knows best"" is absolutely NOT true all of the time. 

How did this turn into a rant???? Omg! My bad. But, it's all true so im leaving it. Sorry for this novel lol. Glad OP has a good doctor who is open to hearing what the *patient* wants for *their own body.*

"From what you've said so far, this doctor does not sound like a quack at all. He sounds like a legitimate doctor that is concerned about being troubled by the DEA for over prescribing pain medication. It also sounds like he is doing every thing that he can in order to protect himself while still providing relief to patients that genuinely need it. He may be a little loose with the prescription pad but he certainly does not sound like a quack to me. 

Since you have questions, I would direct all of your concerns to your friend. He is the one that would best be able to answer the questions that you have.

I'm not even bad physically. I didn't have a massive habit and I've kicked the worst of it to a point where it's manageable and almost completely psychological. But still can't deny the pyschological part is there. like if I don't use, how can I not feel like shit right now? that sorta thing. :/ it's not a side effect at all. it's an effect that is reappearing that has always been there but has been hidden under a ablanket of opis for the last few months.

if i would quite happily die, then I don't see how this could possibly be 'not depression'. tbh I think I have worse mental problems. almost every medical professional thinks I'm autistic but that's another matter anyway. talking doesn't help when one ofm y my main problems is being *terrified of speaking to people* and being *practically mute*. i have been like this before i ever *touched* a drug. i dont have ""coping skills"" other than drugs.  i know  tha'ts my problem but i odn't know how to fix it.",coc5s0c,opiates,1423156594,opiate-dreams,2,0

Worse case scenario you will become addicted and not care because you will be high all the time? No honey worse case scenario is you will be dead! You have absolutely no experience with drugs. If you shoot up the first time it will most likely kill you. This shit is not a joke.

You think most of these people are truly happy with the way their lives turned out? Most of them would most likely kill to be in a position you are in. Most people would most likely wish they never got into opiates in the first place because it DESTROYS lives. Not just their lives but their loved ones lives as well. If you actually done your research like you claim, you would be aware of this. 

Ok I get it you are depressed. Depression can cause people to act and feel ways they don't completely understand. Well you know what? Do something about it. Talk to someone. You have everything at your disposal. Get a fucking therapist. Get on a fucking anti depressant. Try to put your life on the right path. Wanting to start a heroin addiction is absolutely ridiculous and selfish. That is in no way a solution to your problem.

Do you know what death from an overdose does to a family? It fucking kills everyone not just the person that overdosed. Watching a family member spiral out of control and eventually die is beyond devastating.

You obviously come from a very loving family and have a lot of advantages not many people do. You know what would happen if you died from an overdose? Your family is going to blame themselves. They are going to think there was more that they could have done. They are going to think it was their fault you were so fucking stupid. This feeling will not go away either. Not in a few months, few years. No it will be there until the day your parents take their last breath. If you ask me this is just an easy way out and you are being extremely selfish. 

Have you ever seen first hand what drugs do to a person? If maybe you actually seen this you wouldn't even be considering this. Go to a city where drugs are easily accessible and just watch the people. Watch a damn documentary or read a book on what addiction does to a person and to whole families. You may start to feel differently.

"ODd on booze and benzos. I dont remember much and was filled on the details after getting out of the hospital. 14 beers deep took 55 ativan instead of 5. Im not sure if thought I was just going to get super fucked up. It was a former friends house and it was his gfs birthday. Shes a complete bitch for many many reasons. But shes claimed I did this to ruin her party. Ok well I passed out in the couch ""friends"" attempted to wake me up once or twice a day for 3 days they would try and feed me a sandwhich and a glass of water. Im told i drank the water but didnt want the food. On day 3 the only real friend in that house said enough was enough and asked his gf ( now wife ( not the birthday girl bitch ) to bring me to the ER. apparently on the way i made her stop at BK for a couple chicken sandwhiches. I ate 2 and almost imediatey redistrubed around the front of her focus. She said the worst was cleaning it out if those books you put the cds in. Anyways we get to the ER and she drops me off right in front of the doors. I got out and started talking to those cement poles that prevent a driver from driving into the glass sliding doors. At this point she lost it laughing and couldnt take it (shes really a sweatheart, contrary to her laughing about this) she watched on of the nurses come out and get me. A woke up in a bed with the doctor and my mom standing over me. The doctor said ""Mr. GanjaHeroX420.... theres no kind way to say this so im just going to say it. If your werent such a heavy set guy (310lbs ish at the time) you would likley not have survived."" My mom didnt say much, she didnt have to her face said it all. I had a doctors appt a few days later, since I have suffered from depression since 13 ( 18 or 19 when this happened ) he asked me if it was a suicide attempt. I swear it wasnt though, my medication has my depression under control to a fucking T! I litteraly have maybe 3-5 ""bad days"" a year where even with my medication I still get super depressed and wonder if I should take the easy way out. For the record i wouldnt, if only because i dont want to hurt friends and family. But 3-5 days a year that i deem ""bad days"" is as good as its ever been. It took several medications until i found effexor which i couldnt be happier with. Just dont miss dose of that shit 6-8 hours after missing my scheduled dose its worse my heroin withdrawls. But ya so my doctor took back my script for ativan so fucking fast! That was my only OD experience but I only remember waking up in the ER. The rest was filled in by friends that were there. They said I was acting as if I was super shitfaced but for 3 days straight.


My only complaint is that it took 3 days for the only reasonable friend to finnaly say it was time to take me to the hospital. 36 hours ok even 48 hours but 72 fucking hours. ",cobuh8w,opiates,1423123555,GanjaHeroX420,2,0

I only vape now), inhaled chunks of weed straight into my lung numerous times, inhaled hair from work, inhaled filed nails from dog feet hundreds of times. Literally the nail filings were the worst though.. i felt that shit the longest in my chest. I had to quit smoking cause honestly i goy really worried about my lung health this year as i developed a sensation i have to breathe out hard at the end of EVERY. SINGLE. BREATHE. Man, youll be aite.  Edit: something nasty about the nail filings.

I did let him use it once but made sure I was going 40 mph so he couldn't jump out...then he wanted to hold it so ""he could listen to music while we drove"" . He didn't wanna hand it back to me I could tell he was planning a jack. So I played on his greed and was like ""hey I need to call my bank n check my balance I might be able to get more than I thought.

That got him to hand me the phone and after checking balance I stuffed my phone in my pocket lol.

Ended up getting about .05 (that's not a typo) for 60 bucks. Was spose to be a fat 40 plus 20 for middle man...he was a huge dude and I wouldn't let my money walk so I was I an alley off Pine (downtown Seattle if you know the area its about the worst for downtown)  with just me and him and his scary ass looking "" dealer"".
