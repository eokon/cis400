"Ok first off you need a good trim. Splits travel up the shaft and unless you cut the dead wood it will continue to be a problem. Next, are these shampoos sulfate free? If not definitely switch to sulfate free products as these products damage hair over time with their harshness. Next I would definitely stop shampooing every day. By constantly stripping the oils you are contributing to the over-oiliness of your scalp. Try shampooing every other day and if you must, only use conditioner to wash your scalp on the non shampoo days. Also as your hair is around bra length it is probably getting mechanical damage from getting into collars and straps and stuff so also look into some nice updos for when you want your hair to chill. Essentially I would recommend looking into a liberal approach to the ""curly girl"" method even though your hair isn't curly.

"Hi! I'm a professional cosmetologist.  I cannot give you the best advice for you without seeing, feeling, and consulting with you directly however I have some advice that may be useful. 1)make sure you are getting your hair trimmed regularly. Split ends left on the ends of your hair will travel up the shaft and cause your hair to be thin and lifeless 2) at my salon we have many clients who have been platinum for years and have very healthy hair, how? They use the right products and go to the right stylist. Ensure that your stylist really has the expertise to be lightening your hair properly and that the chemicals and products they use are quality. A good stylist would do anything in their power to not inflict damage on their clients' hair 3) use professional grade products. I know they can be expensive but they are expensive for good reasons. And note: just because something is sulfate free, does not mean it is healthy for your hair. For you I would recommend pureology's strengthen shampoo and conditioner and their split end salve (a cuticle polisher that helps prevent ends from splitting) 4) proper brushes and combs that do not put too much tension on the hair. A paddle brush or anything without metal might be helpful.

"I like the idea of ticking off set times which you don't pick, however there are probably more appropriate goals to set. For example: Don't get stressed out when the internet is slow or down.  Don't pick when the traffic is heavy or the bus is full. 

Set realistic goals and try to improve on ""Why"" you pick. There has got to be a reason you pick, right?

"All I can do is tell you things that make it better for me, but I've never been able to totally knock the habit.  So, things that *can* help:

* exercise/outdoor time.  This can help with overall anxiety levels
* a good manicure.  Gel polish or good nail wraps, I've found, can really cut the picking just because the thicker nails make it hard to get a good grip.  Regular polish doesn't help as much as it chips faster.  
* moisturize like crazy.  It seems counterintuitive if there's acne involved, but the better I keep my skin the less I have little edges, acne, and dry skin to pick at.  Also for lips specifically, I can only use certain balms, some actually increase picking for me. I like neosporin night treatment - it doesn't feel super greasy or thick when applied so I'm more likely to leave it alone.
* fidget toys like a spinner ring or something you can do with your fingers when you get the urge to pick
* replace the behavior - when you get the urge, just automatically do something else if you can (if I'm at work, I'll get up and walk a loop of the building, or do tricep dips or something.  Harder if you're in the car or somewhere of course)

"accutane doesn't affect the effectiveness of birth control pills as far as i know (from the fda's ipledge contraceptive counseling booklet: ""it is not known if hormonal contraceptives are less effective when used with isotretinoin"").

the reason why ipledge requires two forms of contraceptives is because a lot of women don't take the pill properly and the pharmaceutical companies don't want to risk lawsuits for birth defects in cases when contraceptives fail (which i think is partly the reason why the brand accutane is no longer available in the states).

acceptable secondary forms of contraceptives are male condoms, diaphragm, cervical cap, and the sponge. i haven't used anything other than male condoms for my secondary form, but i don't see why you would have issues as long as you're taking your birth control pills correctly (every day at the same time, not taking it with any antibiotics that might make them less effective, etc) and using the sponge correctly.

I wish I could tell you that there's a solution guaranteed to work, but I can't. You need to try several options. UV works fairly well for me, and if it's prescribed by your dermatologist, you can possibly gain access to UV treatment specifically for hands and feet. Methotrexate can work super well for some people. If it get worse, you may be eligible for biologics. Usually you have to have X percentage of body involvement, but with hands and feet, that's often waived. You can try bandaging a small area -- your elbow, maybe? -- for several weeks. Don't touch the skin between changing the bandage. After six weeks, remove the dressing and never touch your elbow again. Scratching those itchy plaques makes them worse.

Another thing is I read a book by an endocrinologist called The Hormone Cure.

"Well today was Day 5 right up until it wasn't.

I cannot allow myself the joy of making it to day 10 if any of it is a lie or stretched truth.

The scab picking etc was the beginning of the downfall and I created all these nice little stories to cover up my denial that I was failing.

I just attacked the spot on my jaw until I was sure it was cleared out because it popped out a rock I swear. It hurt a lot but not the worst one ever. No blood. Now the typical story I tell myself can unfold..it'll heal faster because there's nothing in it. Faster than what? Faster than if I pick and don't get it out..that's all. Certainly not faster than if I don't pick because then it doesn't have to heal to be unnoticeable. :/

So I won't be making the 10 days before I leave for Mexico. But you know what? that's ok. I'm not going to kill myself because I didn't make it. I made huge progress. I've never been this successful before and I can build from this. 

What put me over the edge today was a highly confrontational situation at work that has yet to be resolved...there's a meeting at 11:30 tmr to sort it out. Not excited. 
I failed because I was sitting not watching tv...eyes glazed over just arguing in my head over and over about this stupid situation I have to deal with. And then I went up to go shower with that still in my mind..an bam nothing could stop me. I couldn't call out to my boyfriend for help cuz my voice disappears while I'm picking..I thought about calling out but it's immediately squished by my mind saying in almost done which is always a lie. And I didn't have my phone to txt my friend not that I would have done that either with my hands preoccupied. I'm just stuck there. The only solution is avoiding the initial lean in. The looking and feeling to see what's there.

"Think about your life holistically in terms of what you can and can't control. You can control how much exercise you get, your diet, how much sleep you have, how much you drink and smoke, how much time you spend with your friends and family, how you spend your time with regards to work, education and the pursuit of your dreams. You can be good and decent, educated, fit and healthy, caring, insightful, and bold. 

I'm not trying to sound like some fluffy psychology 'positive outlook' guru, but when I put the things I can control up against the things that I can't, my skin condition doesn't actually seem that big a deal. I'm too busy working on improving other aspects of my life to worry about something I can't do much about.

I understand your position because at your age I didn't want to hear this. I told plenty of people to fuck off because they didn't get it. I used to get so mad at people who would tell me that ""Stress is a trigger so stop stressing!"" because it's like telling a depressed person to cheer up and stop being sad. I told people that no woman would ever want to be near me and that they should shut up and leave me be. I was obsessed with what I couldn't change and wilfully ignoring everything that I could. 

Don't be wrong like I was. I was so very wrong. Nobody who is going to matter to you is going to care about your skin. Do something enriching today, regardless of how you feel about your skin. Then do something enriching tomorrow as well and keep on doing enriching things because even though you can't control how your skin looks you can control almost everything else.",cooljif,Psoriasis,1424212888,IPYF,3,0

"Nothing scratched my acne for SEVEN years. Accutane showed improvements within weeks, and now at a little over 5 months my face is almost completely clear. When I look at my old photos I feel sick, disgusted. Has it been easy? No. Am I scared of the potential side effects? Yes. Has it been worth it? Without a shadow of a doubt.



Listen dude, we've all rolled the same dice. It's the chance we take to escape our agony. ""So what if I'm the rare case?"" Well that's just shit luck and I'm sorry it didn't work out. 



All I know is right now I'm enjoying my clear skin and putting up with the usual minor, non serious side effects. If anything worse is waiting for me in the future, then I'll just cross that bridge when I get to it and try deal with it as best as I can.


edit: I'm really sorry if this sounded harsh btw. I guess it's kind of a ""tough love"" post.. I know it's scary man, but you wouldn't be considering this if there were any other options. I guess life is about risks every now and then. If you honestly think you can manage the rest of your life with acne, then fine. But if you are anything like myself then you'll take the drug and accept the consequences. On a lighter/more positive note, over 5 months all I've experienced is dryness, redness and slight fatigue (although that could just be me being lazy).

"I have faced the EXACT same situation. My CSP is from other disorders. Which includes Manic Depression...which includes anxiety. Skin picking is very common with people with anxiety disorders. I pick my nails, face, arms, freaking everything. It scares the crap out of my boyfriend. I just had to explain in to him without sounding crazy..which is difficult. 

I'm not a doctor, obviously, but I've had multiple therapy sessions. The only thing I can suggest is going to see a mental health specialist. There might be a root problem at the bottom of your skin picking. You might be prescribed some meds and have to try different ones...

In the end, maybe you can make peace with the anxieties that are causing you to tear yourself apart, but maybe you can be prescribed something to help you in the long run.


Sorry for dragging on and on, but yeah. You should see a professional and just tell them everything that worries you.

"Hairdresser here, first of all your daughter is adorable. If her hair is a really fine texture, you might want to stay away from regular gel as it will totally weigh her hair down and add unwanted build up in her hair that you don't want. Spray gel is okay, but use very little. As for parting it a certain way, that's just really personal preference, but try experimenting with different partings and see what works for you and her. Try finding her natural part line and work with that. One way of doing that is combing her hair back and slightly push her hair forward with your hand, then you'll see where the hair naturally wants to part.

As for growing her hair out, do it! But make sure she gets regular trims. Very fine hair tends to get very frayed and scraggly and the ends so you want to make sure that you get those dead ends off and keep it heatlhy. This will also help for easier combing as the fine hair will get very tangled as well. 

I agree that Super Cuts tend to rush their clients in and out rather than focusing on the task at hand. You might want to take her to a salon that specializes in children's hair or a stylist who is more experienced in working with children.  You might be paying a little more for it, but it will be worth it and you'll get a better experience out of it. 

I hope this is some what helpful to you. Good Luck!

"Decaf is a good alternative. Probably in other nutrition subs they'd say it's not great because it's more processed but it depends on your objective. It still contains small amounts of caffeine but it's not about aiming for perfect.

You could try asking for half caff if you get coffee out. That's a good compromise. It's unbelievably addictive too so if you did cut down, don't be surprised if you find yourself lapsing into old levels of caffeine intake repeatedly haha. 

Also caffeine is just one part of overall stress management and hormone management.

I don't currently take supplements because it is summer here but I might grab some again in winter. I notice with getting regular sun exposure is that my skin seems to be better overall, even in places not getting much sun like the scalp so perhaps it does more than I think but even so I still have flares and spots that are hard to shift and I must be getting many, many times the vitamin d dose you would get from oral supplements.",coqzc0q,Psoriasis,1424394301,uvreset,1,0

"Day 4. I have mixed feelings. Yesterday was strong. Other than that I picked off a couple of scabs that were peeling off. 
I had a birthday party in the evening for an old friend from high school who I hadn't seen in years. It was sort of a mini high school reunion and I was really stressed about it. The whole evening was a huge success and possibly the best party I have ever been to in my whole life because I didn't feel like I was hiding. There was a photo booth thing that had goofy props...I've always wanted to take photos at one but I have avoided photos since I developed this disease. Yesterday I didn't think twice about it..someone asked me if I wanted to and I said hell yeah I do! And it was fantastic.

Today I have mixed feelings because I picked on thing in the shower just a half hour ago, so it's still lingering in my mind and I can still feel it. 
However today I was home alone most of the day...I did my calculus homework early (usually I'm struggling to finish before bed or am doing it super last minute before it's due Tuesday night.). So that was huge and helped my stress level stay down. All day I was successful..for the past...I have no idea how long..whenever I've been home alone it turns into a huge binge day. So I'm very proud of myself for that.

The only thing I'm struggling with is the one I picked in the shower because of my mentality while I was doing it. It was my old way of thinking...it was the one spot that caused me to restart 4 days ago that's on my jaw line. It still hasn't healed and I know that's because I was so brutal to it...But my mind convinced me that it was because there was something in it preventing it from healing. I felt like I got something out when I did pick it...and it doesn't look bad..it's just the thoughts that concern me a lot.

So I'm still calling it day 4 because everything else about these past 4 days has been on target and phenomenal. I'm not going to let this one thing stop me. I just really have to keep an eye on that particular train of thought because it is clearly the one to which I am most susceptible.

Oh also..I haven't picked anything new (and there have been a bunch of small new ones that I'd normally attack causing bigger ones and the cycle to continue until my face is a painful mess.). One tiny exception of one that was next to a scab I took off yesterday but it's already healed and basically gone.

6 Days left and I cannot wait to experience the next thing that makes me say wow! I can't believe I just did that it felt amazing! Like the photo booth yesterday. :)

"Don't let it get you down my friend. I'm 25 now, and first got psoriasis when I was 19. I knew what it was straight away as I knew someone else that had it. I tried all the creams and some of them give a temporary relief but never do they make your skin good again. The only thing that is reliable for me is UVB light treatment. That treatment brings my skin back to 100% how it used to be, the only thing is that it lasts for between 2 and 9 months at a time and then you have to do it again. It requires you to get into a sun shower type booth with blue bulbs 3 times a week for a few minutes at a time. If you have dark hair and tan easily then it will be perfect - if you're ginger unfortunately you're gonna burn and probably won't see much improvement at all. Hope I helped!

"When I do the masque, I don't do the basic conditioner. The main reason I have all them in my shower (aside from the fact that I'm a product junkie) is that the schedule I'm on with my hair works well for me. I shampoo/condition one week, then shampoo/masque the next week. I also use Anti Snap every time I shampoo my hair, regardless of using the regular conditioner or the masque. The entire extreme line is a great system. In salon, we sell the shampoo for $15, conditioner for $16, Anti Snap for $17.50, and the masque for $17. 

No matter what professional brand you go with (professional meaning purchased in a good salon), you're getting a great deal on shampoo. The price may seem higher, but there are a few factors that go into that. 1) the product is made with higher quality ingredients 2)you can use less of the product, consider most store brand/""over the counter"" brand shampoos are packaged with water 3) focus the shampoo on your root area, then work your way down, while focusing your conditioner on your ends and work your way up.

If you're paying money for your hair cut (and color), your products are essentially your insurance policy for you hair. If you use the correct amount of a shampoo and conditioner per use, and seeing how many uses are in a basic bottle of shampoo/conditioner, you're only spending pocket change per wash. At that price, how can you afford not to take care of you hair?  :)

"Reds and violets are the fastest fading hair colours. A lot of people think that using 30 or 40 vol will make your colour brighter, or lift it more. While it DOES lift more, it also tends to dilute the colour and disperse the molecules that are penetrating within the hair. I'm not sure what the natural level of your brown hair is, but unless your hair is very very dark it's incredibly unlikely you would require 40vol on your hair. Especially on the roots (that's a good way to get hot roots- roots that are lighter than the rest). Because I don't know what your hair looks like, this is mostly speculation... 

If you have excessive colour build up on the ends of your hair, or your hair is very porous on the ends it may be contributing to your quick fade on the middle/ends. One thing you might be able to do after you get your hair dyed is glaze over top of the colour with a semi-permanent gloss colour similar to lock in the initial colour. 

Be sure you're using colour-safe shampoo recommended by your salon. Drugstore products that claim to be colour safe are never guaranteed. Also, sulfate-free shampoos are a good idea simply because they are a slightly less abrasive lather and will open the cuticle of the hair a little less. If you use any hot tools (including a blowdryer) on your hair be sure you're also using a good heat protectant! Damage from the heat can make colour fade MUCH quicker!

I was put on accutane by a derm. She had me take blood samples before to check that my values were ok pre-treatment.

She told me to get another blood sample about a month into the treatment just to check that nothing has gone wrong. Some things had risen a bit but they were still on safe levels. She had me come visit her when I was back in town (moved away just as I started my treatment). This was probably 2-3 months in or so. She wanted to see the progress and make sure I was feeling ok. After that she told me that I did not need any more samples and as long as I didn't start feeling worse I should continue on as usual until I have finished all the pills I had been prescribed.

"hey, i just want to let you know that i've been in your shoes. I've been in your shoes in high school when I didn't even have terrible acne--i had times when I lost friends and didn't have a solid group to depend on. I've eaten lunch in far off hallways and hid in the bathroom to pass the time. It sucks. Believe me when I say that part of this is just high school and being a teenager. Part of what you're feeling stems from the acne and if you're already taking accutane then you're on the right track. Just know that it doesn't improve linearly, there are going to be ups and downs (yes, breakouts even a few months in) and that is completely normal and you should expect it.

I want to let you know i've been in your shoes when I was in college too. I'm glad you're taking care of this now in high school because it felt way worse to have disabling acne in college, mostly because everyone else had already outgrown their acne. Not only this, it took me many many months to work up the courage to see a dermatologist and finally try accutane. It was terrible and I was very depressed and had to vent many times just like you did. 

In the end, you keep on pushing through. Find ways to like yourself for who you are beneath your skin. Find a good group of friends, surround yourself with good people. Be kind to everyone and don't expect anything in return. Best of luck,",coanaxl,Accutane,1423027225,Therapist13,1,0

"She's so cute! 

One thing that is really helpful is to get the correct shampoo/conditioner for her hair type. Something that caters to fine hair, which will be quite lightweight and non-drying. And you only need to use a little, since she's got such short hair. Since her hair is a little curly, it will appreciate the special treatment. 

I suggest going to Whole Foods, and looking at their children's shampoos/conditioners for fine hair. Their body care associates are very helpful, and that way you'll be sure the haircare has only good ingredients for your little one. 

After you've washed her hair, pat the hair try very gently (don't ""scrub"" it like some parents do for fun with towels after bath time), and then gently run a wide-tooth comb through it to untangle. Curly, fine hair is very fragile, especially when wet, so this will help it stay strong and help it grow.

You just need to decide if you want to go back to this brown that you had before, or if you want to attempt to tone it out to a level or so lighter.  Each has their own set of instructions.

That would put blue and violets into your hair and neutralize the gold and orange that you currently have.  This may also leave the hair looking a bit drab, but I think this is just my opinion so ignore it.  
You can go to an inbetween brown by buying a tube of 5N and a tube of 6A and mix them in equal parts.  The 6A will provide the tonal difference while not making it look too dark, and the 5N will build your base and still allow some warmth to come in.  That's probably your best bet for getting super natural looking hair.  
So off to the beauty supply, and remember since you're going darker you don't need anything stronger than a 10 volume developer, and if you go to Sally's stay away from Age Beautiful.  Color Ion might be the best fit for you.  

You can also interchange these with a 6 and 7 for a lighter haircolor.  ",cp007p2,Hair,1425141700,iheartzombiecats,1,0

It doesn't need to be directly onto the skin. Again, basically **any** heat source that locally warms an area of her skin could have done this, and my suspicion is that it was the hot water bottle. In fact, some people refer to this as ""hot water bottle rash."" Seriously. Could her illness/hospitalization have increased her susceptibility or hastened the onset? It's plausible but I don't know, and I doubt anyone else does. Our bodies do very strange things.

"Hello.

Honestly, you’ve got a pretty good understanding of what’s going on, except for one aspect in particular: the risk of transformation to melanoma appears very low for biopsy-proved mildly or even moderately dysplastic nevi.  A moderately dysplastic nevus is NOT considered to be a PRE-malignant lesion, but rather an indicator that someone has a tendency to make dysplatic nevi. Many would argue, quite convincingly, that routine surgical excision of such nevi with positive biopsy margins is not be indicated.  However it’s still very frequently performed, always with other factors taken into consideration (e.g. location, clinical appearance of the lesion, pathologist recommendations, foci of “severe” atypia[like yours]).

“Neoplasm of uncertain behavior” is just a standard phrase we all use when we send something to pathologists for more info. Symmetry suggest a benign lesion. The keratin/neutrophil crust suggests injury to the surface. “Compound” means involving both (1) junction between the epidermis/dermis AND (2) the deeper dermis: many benign moles can do this; they’re usually dark AND raised. Mitotic activity means cell division, a high amount of which would suggest malignancy. Pigment incontinence means the melanin produced by the melanocytes is being lost by the cells they deliver it to, a nonspecific feature which can happen in many conditions, anytime there’s inflammation near the dermo-epidermal junction.

Given the history of evolution over the last three months, getting this biopsied was absolutely the right thing to do. It sounds like you’re in good hands: you’ve had more than one dermatopathologist look at this (the conference). And have appropriate followup. I encourage you trust your team’s decisions.

"No joke, this stuff works. I bought this exact bottle about a month ago after consistently biting my nails for months (years?) without being able to stop (I was also a chronic nail biter as a kid, so this is a deeply ingrained and absentminded habit, though I have managed to stop for years at a time before). After just one application I stopped in a few days and haven't relapsed. A couple days ago I caught myself starting to absentmindedly reach for my mouth and immediately reapplied. Never did that again.

My only complaint is that the bitter flavoring transfers easily to anything your nails or fingers touch. When I have it on, I can't eat anything with my hands without getting that nasty flavor, and flossing was disgusting. And the taste would linger on my lips after eating or flossing or putting moisturizer on, so any time I licked them it was a gross reminder (maybe this would be good for someone who bites their lips, though). Washing my hands and face didn't seem to get rid of it either, which was frustrating. I was knitting a baby blanket the week I had it on, and it even got onto my knitting (yes, I licked it once I realized that it was transferring to so much stuff). I washed the blanket, but I hope that it didn't stick for that poor baby to discover.

What I think is interesting about it is that the flavor itself isn't *so bad* -- after all, it didn't prevent me from flossing. It doesn't work because it's gross, it works because it's a very strong and pungent (and lingering) reminder that I shouldn't be putting my fingers in my mouth. I wish there was some way I could activate the same taste buds or some other unpleasant sensation any time I started picking my skin. If someone ever developed this, I bet it would work for a lot of dermatillomaniacs.

Don't forget to use lots of conditioner afterwards as Head &amp; Shoulders is not very healthy for your hair. How well it works on a permanent dye though, I don't know. Also keep in mind that as dye fades, the colour may get lighter so your highlights may be slightly more visible, but it also tends to look less vibrant and pretty depending on the colour.

There are other ways to get the dye out at home, but I don't have experience with those as I have my hair dyed by a professional. (box dye really damaged my hair when I was younger so I tend to stay away from it now) I feel like it would be wrong for me to give you any advice on those other methods without fully knowing how it would affect the health of your hair. If you really want to go lighter again and washing doesn't work, I personally would advice you to see a professional as they will be able to lift it with minimal to no damage. 

Maybe someone else can point you in the right direction when it comes to those other ways of getting it out at home.",cos0rhw,Hair,1424477097,Snugglepuddlesx3,2,0

You can sort of wager that short hair would look nice on you if you look good with all your hair pulled back/in a bun. Which you do. It shows off your jaw more, which is good in your case.

Just know that it's hard to straighten short hair, so you'll have to tame the curls. And don't just try to hide them, find a way to make them work with mousse or something.

"it started out really mild for me but has gotten pretty bad the last 2 years.

Started out in my knees, but now its in a few toes, ankles, left hand, and neck. 

Neck is the worst, I can't really move it much anymore, and ankles are shot too.

I think there's cases for both where it remains mild for people but also where it becomes disabling.

if its really really mild, just a NSAID or a prescription NSAID will do I would think, however once things start going downhill you'll need to ramp up to either a biologic drug (like Humira, Enbrel, etc) or Methotrexate.

Best thing to do though is to make sure to go to a good Rheumatologist and keep up the treatments so you can help prevent permanent joint damage.",coi4gsq,Psoriasis,1423664571,charleston-kayak,2,0

"That's okay!  I haven't really seen my natural colour since the 6th grade, so I'm an old pro.  Yup, to go back to black you would just dye over whatever you have.  One of the easiest things to do, especially for a professional.  It's hard to say what the purple/red would turn into once it fades, there are a lot of factors that can determine that, but generally speaking it would just gradually become lighter, less intense.  It depends on how light your hair was bleached underneath it.  It's easy to do touch ups for that colour once your hair is bleached, though.  That's the only hard part.  If you wanted to dry something less dramatic to see how you like it you could always dye your hair with a bright red dye over your natural.  I had an Indian friend with hair very similar to yours and she did this.  It was really pretty, just sort of made her hair shine a little red when the light caught it, but it looked pretty much the same.  It would slowly fade until her hair looked totally normal, then she would do it again.  Might be a nice non-committal way to try something new.  Also, red is one of the hardest colours to keep in hair, so it fades quite quickly. ",cof8f4y,Hair,1423425962,AllyPent,2,0

"Getting my nails done, acrylic, at a salon, with an oval tip, helps more than anything else for me. Anytime I get my ""nails"" taken off and revert back to my natural nails my skin follows the progressive downward spiral of its own demise at my fingertips. The edges of acrylic nails, I find to be a lot more dull than the edges of my own natural nails which are very sharp. Be sure not to get just a powder overlay over your actual nails, which can still leave the sharp edge of your natural nails slightly exposed, but a full on acrylic and gel powder set of fake nails from a salon.

Once again, once the nails come off, i find myself reverting back to the same old habits so I'm still looking for a long term solution as well, but in the meantime, acrylics and hydrocolloid acne patches have really helped me.

"A great way to get a basis of what hairstyle might look good is to identify your [face shape](https://makeup4real.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/face2.jpg) and then find some celebrities with a similar shape to reference from.

It's sort of tricky to figure out your shape, especially since it can look different depending on the angle. But I'd say, like me, you're more of a [square shape](http://www.marieclaire.co.uk/beauty/galleries/37106/hairstyles-for-square-faces.html). This means you may want to check out the hairstyles of Rachel McAdams, Jessica Simpson, Julianne Moore, etc.

As for color, I'd like to recommend something but your images aren't the best lighting/current age wise. If I had to base it off of the images provided, I'd say dark like in the first one.

Your hair is pretty much exactly like mine. It's fine/thin and naturally a bit curly. I want you to try a few things (if you want)!

1.) Use Extra Virgin Coconut Oil (it's usually in the vitamins section, not groceries). Take a shower, pat it dry and then add a *little* bit of coconut oil (you can scoop it out, rub it between the tips of your fingers on both hands and then hand comb it into your hair). Mostly get it from the mid-section of your hair and down, avoiding the roots if you have an oily hair issue. I swear, this stuff makes my hair dry 60% straighter and just looks nicer overall.

2.) After taking a shower/pat drying, put your hair in pigtail braids until it's dry or almost dry. Then brush it and just leave it be for 15mins or so. The curls may look crazy at first, but once they settle it can look very pretty and just adds a variation to your normal curls. You can try different types of braids and see how it ends up.

I'm sorry if this is completely irrelevant to your entire question. But it's the most helpful I can be.

"Oh that's a very good point!!! VERY IMPORTANT POINT! 

No I did not intend to imply that anyone would be ""cured"" within that week. I meant it's a week long of daily activities to help get you there.
There's going to be a lot of deep thinking so I couldn't put it all into one day or one post, it would be way too overwhelming. Id spread it over a longer time span if I had time. That's also why I put ""cure"" in the post title with quotes because it's not like you take the medicine and the pain goes away in 10 minutes. I'm going right back to the beginning of my process that led to success and going through the steps that built on each other until I got here.

I could compare it to a yoga workshop I went to once. Where each class focused on a different chakra but you didn't go anticipating to open all of your chakras successfully right there. (I don't know how much of that stuff I'm into personally but the workshop was interesting.) Each day will essentially be it's own topic that requires work and thought. At the end is the complete package that when put together over time leads to success.

I also have no intent or desire to discredit any work of professionals who deal with this daily. I'm just a person who's been through the disorder and explaining the method I used to get here. There will likely be a lot of similarities, I doubt I have anything to say that is a breakthrough on the topic. I just have an idea for how to present the information that I think will be helpful for people, especially those who have not been able to/don't want to go see a professional.

---

&gt;

&gt;In [medicine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicine), __nail clubbing__  (also known as __drumstick fingers__ and __watch-glass nails__)  is a deformity of the [fingers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger) and [fingernails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nail_(anatomy\)) associated with a number of diseases, mostly of the [heart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_disease) and [lungs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lung_disease).  :656 [Hippocrates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hippocrates) was probably the first to document clubbing as a sign of disease, and the phenomenon is therefore occasionally called __Hippocratic fingers__.

&gt;[Idiopathic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idiopathic) clubbing can also occur, but is rare.

Dermatologists and rheumatologists can go hand in hand because you can develope psoriatic arthritis having psoriasis.

"Everyone has parts of themselves that are a bit odd, whether its the psoriasis I inherited from my mom, or the mustache I (a female) also inherited from my mom. The mustache is much easier to take care of, but if ignored its equally visible. Either way, you learn how to improve the situation, and make it less noticeable. 

That being said, deciding that you don't care, and that your personality is more important that your skin, does more for your social life than magically getting rid of the psoriasis could ever do. If you look at yourself in the mirror every morning and point out one good feature, slowly, even if the psoriasis looks the same your personality will shine through.

You are in recovery right now.  If you can go five days without picking you are MUCH farther down the recovery road than you know.

"I'm primarily a lip picker, though I'll peel my nails if they get rough/jagged/peely.  Anyway, here goes...

**physical**

* Feeling a rough edge or bump on my lips
* Dry or ""thick"" feeling skin
* the tingly/itchy feeling as skin attempts to heal
* Being physically twitchy/fidgety

**Social**

* People mentioning my lips look messed up or telling me to stop (this m akes me obsess about it until the next opportunity)
* Anticipating confrontation or unpleasant conversation
* Anticipating potentially awkward/upsetting family drama

**Emotional**

* Anxiety
* BOREDOM

**Mental**

* Being deep in thought or working out a problem
* Feeling trapped/confined (in the car, at my desk, anywhere where I'm not really able to move. Wasn't sure exactly where to put this one)


You know, it's weird, doing this the ""trapped/confined"" thing is really noticeable, though I have lots of different ways of saying it/experiencing it (like when I used to be stuck in a chair breastfeeding, or when I'm stuck in a car - I always thought those instances were more about being ""zoned out"" and in my own head, but the commonality is more about being ""stuck"" in a physical spot).

"Doesn't look anything like the plaques that I get, but it's a disease with very variable symptoms. I get plaques on and near my ears, too. Keep an eye out for them showing up on your scalp. Fortunately the plaques above my neck seem to respond the most quickly to steroid ointments.

The main tip I would offer is that if you are supposed to be applying a steroid ointment to your plaques, make sure you do it at least twice a day. I have a prescription for clobetasol and for 90% of the plaques that I get, once-daily application will not clear them up. Twice-daily will usually take care of them within a couple of months.

"From what I've seen, and how we train future professionals here, when used properly- the razor can be an amazing cutting tool. There are several companies that base their cutting techniques on using a razor. However, the down side of that is the people who improperly use one. A single hair is not just a solid strand: there are many layers are a core. When a razor is applied to the hair in an incorrect way, it shreds the fabulous layers of that strand and can damage the core. This can cause styling trouble due to frizz and future breakage. When scissors are used to cut hair, depending on what kind of shears they are, they cut a solid and fluid line. In our salon, to soften that line (which is pretty harsh in most haircuts) we use texture blades (these can be used to thin hair, but are not thinning shears--there is a huge difference). We can create a fun, whimsical style with the edgy layers and different textures all with our blades. By the same token, some people misuse texture blades, too. It all comes down to proper training! Like I was saying before, though, we do use a feather blade razor to blend hairlines on very short cuts, or to eliminate those stray baby hairs that grow outside of the hairline on haircuts for our clients who pull their hair up often.

If your stylist is doing your entire hair cut with a razor, and you're not noticing any damage, that's great!!! Really, as long as the stylist taking care of you is well trained and listening to your hair needs--your in good hands :) no need to worry!!",coknd1k,Hair,1423861050,susanfancyyyy,1,0

"The first I can remember was a spot on feet and behind my ear at around 8yo. It was on scalp, arms and torso in my teens. At college I was a flake monster and it caused be to be very withdrawn and I dropped lots of classes through non-attendance and it had a massive impact on career prospects and my social life. If I had a time machine I would go back and beat some sense into early me and get some treatment instead of feeling sorry for myself.

While there is no proof of dietary links my diet at college was crap, I didn't get any sun, I picked at my skin which made it worse and all I had for treatment was topicals that kept running out. Pretty much a disaster combination.

Now days I find regular sun exposure keeps me clear enough to mostly enjoy my life through most of the year. If I was in a different climate I would have to depend on a dermatologist to get similar results. While not quite perfect my skin is good enough for tshirt and shorts and my scalp and face aren't an issue. I sometimes get almost clear.

"As an RN for a dermatology office this does NOT look like molluscum contagiosum.  The areas you post are very odd to have outbreaks for one (in adults), and two, the lesions themselves do not appear to be umbilicated (indented).

Also the fact that they burn and itch leads me to believe that it is some form of dermatitis. 

Now your first goal should be to alleviate symptoms.  Try some over-the-counter hydrocortisone first to see if it will alleviate the itching at least.  If new lesions keep popping up, I want you to see a dermatologist who performs ""PUNCH BIOPSIES."" This type of biopsy will extract a lesion with the surrounding tissue to let the dermatopathologist know what to look for.  Tell your new dermatologist everything you posted on here, previous treatments, your previous diagnoses, and ideally, the records from your previous visits so that way your new doctor can review their physical exams.

Good luck!

"Good being proactive!  Keep trying to get help from every resource you can. Just an idea your GP might benefit from reading the print out of the wiki page referred to in this site.  If you find a therapist you like you can do the same if they haven't treated a lot of people with OCD/CSP.   I know from my own experience that it can get very serious very fast from the point you where you are right now.  My red flag was when I was in that CSP trance state where you are convinced you are helping your skin and I thought to myself ""I can really do a much better job on this bump if I had a scalpel""!!  When I got out of that picking trance I realized I didn't have such implements in my house for that very reason.  Remembering that thought when I was out of that trance scared me to death and scared me that my mind could even go there!  I knew something was very wrong at point and that I really needed help and I immediately went into therapy and also to a psychiatrist who gave me meds for OCD and CSP.  I have been in remission for a while because of that but it was a long journey.  But I did get better and better slowly.  Now the idea of taking a scalpel to a bump is horrendous to me. I knew after healing that using a scalpel to ""help"" my skin was a totally deluded thought  and Oh my God what could have happened if I didn't get help!  You can get better - just keep moving forward towards help.  With your doctors help you can put the brakes on where you are and then start to move towards healing.  Are there any support groups in your area that meet in person to give each other support?  An OCD support group would work or if you can find one specifically for CSP even better.  You need emotional and medical support and intervention NOW.  Good going about your GP appointment and searching for a therapist.

"My gosh, your entire foot looks like what I do to my pinky toes! (and often my other toes, but the pinky toes are my primary problem.) I just did it to my left pinky toe so badly it hurt while walking last week.

It's stupid, but what helps me avoid doing it too often is wearing socks all the damn time. I basically never take my socks off, because if I do, I end up trying to tear my toenails off with my teeth. Of course, this means when I finally do expose my bare feet, the toenails are a bit long and sometimes have sock lint under them, but that gives me a satisfying length of nail to deal with before I put my socks back on.

I find the lip-biting is more a problem for me when I'm stressed, so I try to avoid stressors and be easygoing in life. Stress also triggers all sorts of other weird little compulsions, so that helps with all of them.

Alas, would that ahy of this had any effect on my scab-picking and other blemish-scratching.

"I hope this doesn't sound bitchy, but you're never going to have it fade to lavender, it's just not possible. The reason you're hair fades to a warmer shade is basic color theory. RED + blue = purple, you're putting red color on your head, even if the results are purple; especially if you're going for a burgundy, which is a red shade with added violet tones. Also in order for a lavender shade to even be slightly possible you'd have to have nearly white hair to start with. 

Also, hair color is not meant to actually be permanent. It's molecular structure changes while its in the hair shaft and once its exposed to different elements its going to change again. If you're waiting months before recoloring, you're never going to be satisfied with your hair. That's why professionals like myself recommend coloring every 4-6 weeks.",coi8kqo,Hair,1423672409,benhur500,1,0

"I was diagnosed in my early 30s. I'm currently 42. I used to be reasonably active (I did a lot of camping, scuba diving, 3-day outdoor concert festivals, etc) but can no longer do any of those things consistently. As my condition worsened I ended up having to stop working (a year ago) and am currently on disability. These days about the most activity I can hope for on a good day is being able to go grocery shopping or a small amount of walking.

I've been on biologics for something like 5-6 years and they've helped - I would give them a strong recommendation. Humira and Enbrel both worked for about 2 years before they stopped being effective. I'm currently on Cimzia and it's helping but not as much as the previous two at their best. 

My advice for someone your age is to stay as active as possible. Enjoy as much stuff as you can now. Never turn down an opportunity to do something physical that you enjoy because you might not be able to do it in 10 or 15 years. However also make sure not to stress out about possibilities too much - stress makes autoimmune diseases worse, so worrying about it can actually contribute to exactly what you're scared of. My situation isn't something that happens to everyone, and new medications are coming out every year. 

I'm personally still optimistic that some new drug will come out that will greatly reduce my symptoms. I still have a few good days here and there where I feel relatively symptom-free and I treasure the HELL out of them. I'm confident that as long as I keep my joints reasonably mobile and do my best to prevent the permanent damage that can come about from being too inactive (like ""joint locking"" that happens simply from not moving a joint too long) that I'll eventually be better. Giving up is not an option :)",coo4wbb,Psoriasis,1424184801,Xkot,2,0

"I feel that a big problem with our condition is that we feel a stigma about it. The stigma against talking about it sort of fuels my anxiety and exacerbates the problem. I used to make up some sort of excuse and hope they bought it, but now I just reply with candid honesty.

""I compulsively pick at my skin sometimes"" is my go-to response. Sometimes it leads to a conversation where the other person learns a little bit about me and the habit. Either way, I am generally surprised by how people react in a positive way and I feel good being open and honest about aspects of my daily life. 

Talking about mental health issues, OCD, and anything else that has stigma is a really good way of fixing the problem.

tldr: I tell the truth to try to remove the stigma.

EDIT: Also, to those of us that feel it is rude to inquire about it, I challenge you to rethink that notion.

You can tell the barber what you're looking for and he should be able to steer you in the right direction. Also tell them how you want your hair parted.

"I'm awful when it comes to picking, and it made my skin terrible when starting accutane because the marks were super dry and flaky (which made me want to pick them more). My IB was only about 3 weeks long, but it took about 2 months to clear because I kept picking at the scabs before they could heal. Before accutane I had moderate, non-cystic acne as well, about 5-6 pimples at any given time, but during that breakout/healing period it was closer to 15 big spots and a bunch of little ones.

After a while I finally had enough and kept a thick layer of aquaphor all over my face for 24 hours/day for a 3-day weekend (I was stuck inside studying, 'cause it looks super shiny and gross), and after that weekend, they'd all had a chance to heal enough to the point where they were just marks and not really ""pickable"" any more. Now that I only get 1-2 pimples at a time, I just use the aquaphor on the actual zits when I'm studying, which is when I pick the most. It helps keep your skin nice and moisturized, and kind of stops you from picking because it's all sticky, so it stops you from being able to do it subconsciously.

I don't have as much of a compulsion with popping, but people at /r/skincareaddiction keep mentioning hydrocolloid bandages to help bring the white stuff to the surface without causing all the damage that popping does.

Re the fatigue: I hope your doc is monitoring for vitamins. Mine ran some blood tests and put me on B-12 1,000 mg/day. Then vitamin D 1,000 iu/day. I felt my energy rise when I added each of these.

Then an acquaintance said, ""I take 5,000 iu of vitamin D per day in the winter (some smaller amount in the summer)."" I thought it sounded kooky, especially since my doctor recommended 1,000.

"**Lip Balm:** Definitely Aquaphor Healing Ointment. Also use it on top of face moisturuzer, around eyes, inside nose, and *everywhere* you feel dry!

**Soap:** Dove Deep Moisture Beauty Bar. Very non-stripping yet effective. 

**Shampoo:** Keep using whatever you are using, just reduce the number of days you use it. Shampoo every three days for example and use conditioner everyday. If your scalp still dries out uncomfortably, sulfate-free shampoos are milder than SLS and SLES containing ones. 

**Night Moisturizer:** CeraVe Moisturizing Cream or Cetaphil Moisturizing Cream. 'In the tub' refers to their packaging, not that you apply them while *you* are in the tub!! Also apply on your entire body right out of the shower. 

**Day Moisturizer / Sunscreen:** Must definitely contain atleast SPF 30. Preferably has only zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide (because these are less irritating than say Avobenzone). CeraVe AM Lotion SPF 30 and EltaMD UV Clear SPF 46 are good. Use atleast 1/4 tsp on face!

**Shaving Razor:** I'm a girl and use a regular men's razor on my body. I use baby oil to shave. You can also use hair conditioner...

**Nose:** Aquaphor or Vaseline inside nostrils.

**Eyes:** Any hydrating eye drops you can afford. Ex: Visine or Systane. 

Lastly, you need a **facial cleanser**. I recommend CeraVe or Cetaphil. Cleanse every night, pat dry, apply moisturizing cream, top with aquaphor, and you are golden. I'm 3 weeks in and have zero dryness.

I'll be honest mate, It's hard. It's an extremely visible condition in some people, lots of people have it in very sensitive areas too, such as genitals.

For me, i used to have it on my eyelids really bad. I would wake up in the morning and it would rip open when i opened my eyes. My eyes would weep periodically throughout the day, but the hardest part of it was people making eye contact with me throughout the day.


You automatically assume people are looking at your P. But I'll be honest, 99% of people dont notice/dont give a shit. One thing that keeps me going - Nobody really cares. You'll come across the occasional asshole who makes a big deal about it, but they are few and far between.


I've had P now for 15 years. Since I was 12. I had to deal with it throughout school, College, University, and my first few years of work.


Honestly, it gets better as you get older. You start to realise that having P isnt that bad. There's a lot of people out there with it, and a lot of people who have even more disfiguring things with their body.


It gets easier with time. Just try and find a treatment that keeps it under control, and do your best. In life we have to deal the cards we are dealt.

"The resulting mass after mixing henna with water will be drippy and can turn you bathroom into a mess. Seriously, it will drip all over everything if you're not careful, so wear old clothing and prepare a washcloth to remove stains. After you rinsed you hair out, remnove the henna stains with oil and a washcloth or it will stain it. (Source: been there before.... but nothing that good 'ol chemicals can't fix, so don't worry too much.)
And since you don't dye all of your hair, only the bottom, i can imagine that the mess will be quite tame.

But: if you're not careful, you can stain your face with henna and some parts can turn yellow (at least with red henna, don't know what will happen with black henna) so remove any henna that lands on your face with oil. 

Henna smells like... hmmm... hay? I guess, so your hair will smell like hay for a few days, but I actually like that smell so I have no problem with that, and it's very faint so you won't notice it after a few minutes.

Also: if you dye your hair with henna, You CANNOT dye over it again, even if you try bleaching it, there will always be (at best) a black shimmer over hair you dyed.

Well, dyeing with henna now sounds a bit scary, (lol) but it's not that bad once you got the hang out of it and I asure you, the end result will be worth it in the end.

The trick for something like this is tousling it through all of your hair and mess your hair up as much as possible to disperse the product evenly on your hair. After you've got the product off of your hands, THEN proceed to shape your hair the way you would like! (i.e. gently move the hair into the mowhawk shape).

A lot of people tend to make the mistake with short hair styling that they want the product to be where the style needs to sit.

I follow these dietary suggestions found here: https://www.inspire.com/groups/talk-psoriasis/discussion/foods-to-eat-and-foods-to-avoid/ (actually right now 90% of my diet is soylent)

And I use a topical cream with viola tricolor as an active ingredient (here is the scientific article about viola tricolor and psoriasis which is what made me look for a cream with viola tricolor: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3918579/)

The specific ointment/cream I use is here: http://www.serenaskin.com/psoriasis.php but there are certainly other companies that have viola tricolor as an active ingredient in their psoriasis creams.

It's taken a good six months to get off of methotrexate and the psoriasis has come back with a vengeance. I had forgotten how intense the pain from psoriasis (swollen eyelids) can be compared to joint pain from RA. I had to get off methotrexate because I had been at maximum dosage for several years and the RA was acting up.  I'm doing Humira now and still getting use to it and slowly getting all of my psoriasis under control. Hopefully you can start on a small dosage of methotrexate for your psoriasis and that's all you'll need.

"This is my second time on Accutane for 6 months, I'm currently in the 4th month and not having a great time. I remember the first treatment when I was on 40mg/day, I never really had side effects except for extremely dry skin during the winter. On every monthly lipid test at the hospital, I showed up completely fine. My acne went away for a pretty long period of time after the treatment but came back even worse than before two years later. Now, I'm on 60mg/day, I'm noticing terrible mood and anxiety effects. In addition to the Accutane, I was given Prednisone during the second month which introduced me to severe insomnia and moderate depression. Even after finishing the Prednisone, both the insomnia and depression were still present and then my skin started drying up again. On the third lipid test, I was apparently having some issues with liver functions (or something along those lines; I don't really remember since it apparently went away quickly). I was also diagnosed with ADHD-PI last month and have been given Vyvanse and Adderall IR which have made insomnia extremely severe. For me, it was the combination of different prescription drugs that have made Accutane a nightmare. I would say that Accutane on its own is bearable during the winter, but much easier over the summer due to more moisture being in the air preventing your skin from drying out as easily. Most people don't have any of the psychological side effects so you should hopefully be fine! My mood issues are probably related to insomnia more than anything else so make sure you get enough sleep. If insomnia comes up try using Melatonin. While Accutane will get rid of all acne, you probably won't really notice any major acne changes until about the third month of your treatment. So basically just make sure you moisturize, get plenty of rest, and be cautious with side effects of other medications and you should be fine and acne free.

"Typically what people think of when they hear ""Arthritis"" is the aches and pains of just growing old or when a person has an old injury start to get sore again.

Psoriatic Arthritis is a form that is different though, and its lumped together with several other forms. It can occur at any age as well.

Psoriatic Arthritis is similar to Rheumatoid, your body starts attacking your joints actively, leading to loss of range of motion, swelling, fever, and eventually permanent joint damage.

Its a pretty serious condition that taking OTC things like Tylenol aren't going to really cut it.

"Don't now much about baby lotion or what is in it but I thought I would brain dump what I know about moisturiser so far.

Moisturiser is primarily composed of occlusives, humectants and emollients. The rest is perfume, colouring and magic ingredients that likely don't actually do anything and shitloads of branding, package design and advertising (all cosmetics have massive markups and probably spend more on marketing than ingredients).

Humectants attract and keep water on the skin. Glycerine(glycerin/glycerol etc) is a common food additive that you can grab from a supermarket or pharmacy, just grab the cheapest. Water it down and spray it on. You will be tacky all day but never dry. The stuff just sucks water in and keeps it. Obviously you want it watered down when you apply it.

Occlusives cover you in a protective layer that stops stuff getting in or out. The most effective is probably petrolatum (petroleum jelly, soft parrafin etc). You will be tacky all day but it will keep whatever is on your skin there.

Emollients are basically gap filler. They soften your skin and make it feel smooth. Usually oils. Eg coconut oil.

Depending on your skin you may need all or just some of these main actions. Many mainstream moisturisers you buy from shops often seem formulated to not feel tacky or be visible. You rub them on and it seems like the disappear. This is basically throwing money away with psoriasis. If the area is covered or you are at home or in bed sleeping it might be better to go heavy duty, more glycerin, more petrolatum, more oil, less fragrances and fancy branding.",cokw2j2,Psoriasis,1423878164,uvreset,1,0

"Day 2 and I hit that nice familiar wall of failure. I don't feel like talking about my experiences with therapists yet.

Here's my path on the downward spiral.
1) Too many opportunities to look in a mirror to ""check"" that my make up is still covering everything. 
2) ""Leaned in"" a few times...though I stopped myself it was the beginning of the build up.
3) Everything was good at the dentist..I even had a chance to put more make up on to feel better.....BUT....then the dentist touched my face. It was my first time there so I guess he was checking all my glands or whatever for inflammation. I was fine but my anxiety peaked. Then the dental assistant had to mess around cuz I needed preliminary xrays for blah blah dentist stuff. 
4) Then when I got home I sat on the couch and watched tv. That's where my idle hands always get me...my exhaustion takes over and I have no will power to do anything or fight my disease. So I give in and I pick.

At the dentist they asked me prior to all the xrays and stuff what my average daily stress level is..I said 7-8...then said closer to 8.... It's a lie. That's what I am at if I disregard my disease. Every day I hover close to my breaking point. And then I break down (usually cuz I picked but could be just something small cuz I'm too close to the edge) and then I feel myself fall....down down down into a very depressed state. 
Thankfully I know how to deal with that though and I just sit there for a while with my eyes out of focus letting my mind zone out...sometimes it turns into a few hours. The I get up and say ok here we go! It's day 1 ...now!

Which is exactly what I'm here to say. Now is the point in time to look back on and say that was the last time I picked. That was the moment of my freedom from this disease. So it's 10:30pm on February 4, 2015. In exactly 10 full days..240 hours..I will be celebrating with my boyfriend on our first night in Mexico.

"I am a 32 year old male who has had psoriasis since I was about twenty-two. I have a small. dime-sized patch on the man bits as well, the shaft to be specific.

Since you're worried about sex I'll just cut to that. In my experience it doesn't affect sex at all. In fact, sex seems to improve it. My wife and I often spend months apart due to work, and I notice that while not having sex it comes back fairly strong. However, when we are together we usually have sex around 2-4 times per week, and during these times the patch often fades and or goes away completely. I can't offer any explanations as to why, but I can say that the quality of sex is not affected either for her or for me, and that sex itself, for me at least, seems to help heal it overall. If you can find a partner who understands what it is and isn't bothered by it then you're golden. 

I can empathize completely with the worry over it getting worse. Keep in mind that since psoriasis is related to the immune response, worry-induced stress might actually increase the chances that your fears will become a reality. Stay positive. It will help your life in general, even if it doesn't have an effect on your psoriasis.

"Hi! Aww yes, it sounds as if you have CSP. I see by the title of your post you're motivated to stop the picking. You'll probably see in this sub that often, willpower alone is not enough to just stop this.

CSP is much more compulsive. Meaning it's something that you find yourself doing, even when you don't want to do it. As such, it's something worth taking seriously.

If you want to try to stop on your own, then do go ahead. You never know! However, what I'd urge you to do is to set a reminder in your phone on a date in the future. If you haven't managed to get on top of this through your own willpower, this reminder will serve to prompt you to get additional help, whether it's some cognitive behavioural therapy or just trying some different tactics.

For a lot of people to overcome this takes some sustained therapy around anxiety, perfectionism and the skin picking itself. There are some really great posts on this sub about how people have got control of it. This was my recent post about what helped me:

http://www.reddit.com/r/CompulsiveSkinPicking/comments/2tpk82/how_ive_improved_my_skin_picking/

I've by no means stopped, but it's better than it has been for such a long time and month by month is improving gradually. I don't believe I'll ever be totally free of CSP, but I do think I can get it to within a normal range and not have it be a distressing thing that affects my day to day life.

Good for you if you feel confident enough to go without makeup! In no way am I suggesting you should wear makeup, just that if you ever became interested in it again, the skin care addiction sub is really fantastic for helping you figure out which products might be ok for your skin.

"""Will it improve?"" It may, as scars undergo remodeling for up to a years, but likely not to the point of being totally flush with the surrounding. Atrophic scars are common after *any* sort of excisional skin procedure, due to removal of subcutaneous tissue, which normally provides additional density underneath the skin.

Depending on how much it bothers you there are treatment options but they're all cosmetic and have drawbacks: filler injections (expensive, temporary, lasting only months to a year), laser resurfacing/dermabrasion/chemical peels (only help smooth out edges and only useful for *slight* depressions) and scar revision (cutting out the scar and restitching; will leave you with a longer scar that could also be atrophic). 

Where is yours on your scalp? Is it concealed by your hair? If it is, my advise is to just **own it**, save yourself the trouble and leave it at 6mm.

"Hair bleach can be formulated with different ""volume"" developers. Any developer under 30 volumes will not burn your scalp. Dye will only get you blonde if it is a high lift color which is not as effective as bleach if you have dark hair. Remember, color does not lift color! A blonde dye will not make you blonde, it will just add tone to your dark hair. I recommend going to a professional because any time you are lifting pigment from the hair, you will expose underlying contributing pigments. These naturally occuring pigments in your hair will cause your lightened hair to look orangey or yellow. A professional will know how to neutralize unwanted tones. Also, peroxide will not get you as blonde as you would like and it is not good for your hair or scalp, it will dry them both out and damage your hair.",coiq0j9,Hair,1423700945,ex0thermic33,2,0

"Personally, I prefer you with short hair from what I can see in your album, I think it looks super adorable and suits you very well! As far as color, your #1 with the red and yellow hair will require a lot of styling and product, since her hair obviously doesn't do that naturally, so unless you want to spend hours on your hair everyday, I would avoid specifically going for her style, mainly because I have no idea what her hair looks like down (don't take styled hair pictures to a salon, since it's hard to tell length, layers, all that stuff with curled or styled hair). I think the last two are much more realistic and doable, and won't require a lot of time or effort. Those are the types of pics you want to take to a salon since they can see the length and how the hair falls against the face properly. Just my opinions, it's your hair, do what makes you feel good :) also I love the ombre red hair picture, though I'm not sure how an ombre effect would look on short hair because there's less to work with when it comes to fading it into the darker natural color, but I'm not a hair dresser, so just do your research and find a salon that knows what they're doing :)",coir9si,Hair,1423703614,Ladyghoul,2,0

"P.S.  next time you get a cyst, if you can afford to, it might be good to go to the dermatologist just as soon as you can to get it treated.  You can tell the Doctor you have CPS and that it is pretty certain (right now anyway) that you will mess it up really badly unless he can do something right away to help.  Tell him of the razor blade incident so he understands the seriousness of your request.  My therapist says they see a lot of the CSP and are not judgmental.  Also, she said told me be sure to go to ER if I wounded myself (like you did in a trance) and not to be ashamed because they also see a lot of it.  In the U.S. the ERs have to see you.  Just tell them you left your wallet at home due to the crisis and to please bill you.  I did that when my son got hurt once.  Then you can set up a payment plan  when you get the bill.  They can't send you to a collection agency  if you keep up on your payments.   My therapist told me one of her patients punctured a jugular vein with tweezers in a picking frenzy/trance) and had to go to ER and almost died...wow.  So razors are nothing to mess around with.  This is NOT your fault any of it.  You are in crisis right now from an illness that needs treatment.  It is a disorder not a test of your character!

Your fear of the word ""early"" is unwarranted.  Better to be caught early as treatment options (again IF needed) have vastly improved and most patients we see here when treated early live long lives with ""minimal disease activity"" and some experience complete remission.

My trigger is my bathroom mirror. It has heavy lights above it and I can't avoid them 'cause I have to brush my hair/teeth there. I'll think up some way to avoid turning on those lights, or to avoid coming near it at all. I went to the beach last month and when I got back my mom said my skin looked so much better - then I realized I hadn't pick my skin the whole time there 'cause the mirrors were dim and I didn't even bothered with them.

You helped a lot, really! I'll think about how to recognize possible triggers and avoid them.

To return to a level nine will be extremely difficult in my professional opinion you need to track down a salon that uses OLOPLEX in every chemical service since im assuming you have used box color black on it. Which my dear is a giant no no with all the metallic salts that are found in box color the build up will be horrendous making it extremely difficult to fix. Now before you cringe freak out and all that jazz you must remember the above company I just named off oloplex. They are in essence the most amazing thing to hit the market in terms of saving your hair period. I have seen them take a black womans hair from black level 1 to beautiful platinum blonde in one day with no frying breakage anything. I call it the holy grail of hair!

"MORE INFO: It started out as a tiny red pinprick like spot that was tender only when you pressed directly on top of it. It started to get a little raised, and I already had two warts on my hands so I figured it must have been another place the original spread to. 

I started treating it with salicylic acid gel like my two other warts, but stopped when I noticed no change in appearance other than the initial white ring around it. The idea that it was not a wart was confirmed when I was filing off the salicylic acid for the last time it started to ooze clear stuff from the red center.

I have covered it with a bandaid and applied neosporin for the past three days to see if it will heal like that, but little or no change has happened other than it seemed to have become a little more tender.

I still say if you want to fix your skin see a dermatologist not read a book by a chiropractor. Chiros are the biggest bunch of quacks out there and the hypothesis behind Pagano's ""cure"" is standard alternative medicine crap.

Re the fatigue: I hope your doc is monitoring for vitamins. Mine ran some blood tests and put me on B-12 1,000 mg/day. Then vitamin D 1,000 iu/day. I felt my energy rise when I added each of these.

Then an acquaintance said, ""I take 5,000 iu of vitamin D per day in the winter (some smaller amount in the summer)."" I thought it sounded kooky, especially since my doctor recommended 1,000. But then I realized I had the pills right there at home, why not just try it. I looked up overdose levels, verified that 5,000/day was fine, and tried it for a while.

I wanted to cry when it kicked in. I got my life back. I don't have the energy of a normal person, but I can do so many things that I couldn't before.

Plus I added beef about 4 times a week a couple of years back. Also a game-changer. Apparently heme-iron is not found in plants (ie iron supplements) and is absorbed completely differently.

The following day, the spots hadn't changed. I tried on about another ten dresses and by the end of the day, it had evolved into this. 

I've put Benadryl cream on it twice and haven't noticed any change in size or appearance. It does not itch at all. Contact with my shirts is uncomfortable, but not unbearable. I'd compare the sensation to what it feels like to handle fiberglass without gloves.

I plan on going to see my PCM tomorrow, but am curious about what I should expect. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you in advance!

"I'm 25yo male that's had it since I was 13 on my scalp, ears, face, arms, and legs. Aside from topical ointments/creams/foams I get from the Derm doc, (clobetasol propionate), I use coconut oil to moisturize my skin. I also noticed that working out regularly helps keep it at bay and I take mutlivitamin supplements (fish oil, biotin, glucosomine[for my joints-I'm pretty sure I'm developing psoriatic arthritis]). 
I also eat not as much junk and try for a cleaner diet. I'll have oatmeal baths where I soak for ~30mins. Relaxing and cleans the scaly stuff. I do love warm showers and it does increase the flares if I don't moisturize immediately after stepping out. Try as much natural stuff as you can, Aloe vera, coconut oil, etc. 

Dealing with it mentally? The winters are hard, esp living in MN. Little sunlight, dry cold air causes massive flaring on parts of my face, arms, and legs. I wear clothes that cover it and avoid being in situations where I need to wear anything less than long sleeves and pants. Summers are easier because I can find more motivation to take care of my skin and body. The worst flares in the winter will cause scarring and skin bleaching (I'm brown) when I use derm doc prescriptions to quell them. I know people can see the scars in the summer but at the same time, I've gotten to the point where I just don't give a fuck. I'm usually with friends and my gf understands it. I've gotten ignorant comments but then I try to inform people on what it is.  

Living with psoriasis is basically managing it the best you can. It's not going anywhere and the more you take care of yourself the better chance you'll have at managing it.

All the literature seems to suggest narrowband UVB with just the frequencies most effective for clearing psoriasis is the best treatment. But I am not sure exactly what the difference is in risk.

"Based on your other comments I'm guessing you want to do a two step henndigo (henna + indigo). 

First, you'll need to mix up your henna. A lot of this is up to personal preference, I like to use warm tea to mix mine, but others like lemon juice or just plain water. Warm liquids will get the dye to release faster. Dye release can be almost instantaneous or it can take several hours. Your henna is ready when a small dot left on your palm for 30 seconds leaves an orange stain. If your henna is ready before you're ready to dye you can put it in the fridge to stop the dye demising. Leftovers can also be frozen for future use. I aim to get my henna the consistency of greek yogurt, but this is just personal preference. Henna will never be quite the consistency of commercial hair dye, so you might need to adjust your application technique a bit. I find I need to use my hands a lot more than I would with commercial dye, so make sure you have lots of gloves. Once applied you will want to cover your head with cling wrap, a shower cap, or a plastic bag to stop the henna from drying out. If it's allowed to dry out it becomes flaky and is a pain in the butt to get out of your hair. I usually leave my henna on my head for 2 hours, but it's non damaging, so leave it as long as you like. Lots of people sleep with theirs in. I find it easiest to rinse out in the shower with a bunch of cheap conditioner. 

Indigo is mixed up similarly, but you should use water rather than any other liquid. You can add a bit of salt to your mix to help the dye ""stick"" to your hair. Indigo is ready to use immediately after being mixed. Indigo demises about two hours after being mixed, so there is no point leaving it on your hair longer than that. I always find indigo messier and drippier than henna is no matter what consistency I aim for. It's easier to rinse out than henna, but I still find cheap conditioner helpful. 

Henna is pretty much permanent, but indigo can fade the first few times. The salt helps it stick, but you might need to reapply it if it fades. Once indigo decides to stick its pretty well permanent. 

If the two separate applications sound like too much work, you can do a one step henndigo. Mix the henna up as above, and once dye released mix the indigo up in a separate bowl and then combine the two. You're not likely to get black doing a 1 step, but you could get a dark brown.

(pp345–346)Due to the special nature of the [blood](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood) supply to the [human](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human) [nose](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_nose) and surrounding area, it is possible (although very rare) for [retrograde infections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrograde_infection) from the nasal area to spread to the [brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain) causing [cavernous sinus thrombosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavernous_sinus_thrombosis), [meningitis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meningitis) or [brain abscess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain_abscess).

&gt;This is possible because of venous communication (via the [ophthalmic veins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ophthalmic_vein)) between the [facial vein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facial_vein) and the [cavernous sinus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cavernous_sinus). The cavernous sinus lies within the [cranial cavity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cranial_cavity), between layers of the [meninges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meninges) and is a major conduit of venous drainage from the brain. 

&gt;It is a common misconception that the [veins](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vein) of the head do not contain one-way valves like other veins of the circulatory system. In fact, it is not the absence of venous valves but the existence of communications between the facial vein and cavernous sinus and the direction of blood flow that is important in the spread of infection from the face. Most people, but not all, have valves in the veins of the face.

"Always call them up and speak to someone in person at the insurance company, that will help out a ton, because there are so many ""gotchas""

what I look for is a plan that has a ZERO deductible for prescription drugs, and that covers Tier 4, or ""Speciality"" drugs with a low co-pay.

For example, I just renewed my plan with Blue Cross, its got a deductible for office visits and other stuff but its got  a zero deductible for prescriptions, with a copay of 150 for tier 4 drugs. There are several tiers of drugs, no matter what insurance company. Most of the time insurance agents are only used to talking with people that need generics or brand name drugs, but Biologics is a whole 'nother ball game. You'll need to make sure that they specificcally look up the Biologics and make sure that they are covered, not just covered, but have a decent copay and no deductible to meet.

Always always ask about ""Self Injectible Medications"" and give them examples, ""Humira, Stelara, Enbrel"" so they can look it up and tell you whats covered and whats not

the biggest most important thing is that deductible and copay.

If you have a deductible for prescriptions, those injections won't be covered til you meet the deductible which SUCKS.

Also, make sure it is a true copay for this tier of drugs and not ""Co-Insurance"" Co-Inurance is where the insurance company pays say, 70%, and then your on the hook for the other 30%, which may sound like a good deal, but with biologics, that still means your on the hook for nearly $1,000 a month, which is terrible!

Also, all of the biologics have patient assistance programs, even for people with insurance, check those out as well. Humira + Health Insurance drives the total monthly price of the drug down to just $5

Every state's healthplans and companies are different, but I've done both SC, GA, and FLA, and so far the plans I've been on have ranged from 260-320 a month.

This can become infected from moisture trapped under the nails, resulting in gangrene. I've seen cases where women losses fingers, even a hand.

To do it yourself, get a bottle of acetone and a glass bowl. Soak your fingers in it with a towel over the bowl. This allows heat to stay inside and helps the acrylic come off faster.

Do not get another set until your fingers don't ache for at least a week. If you decide to get another set, tell them to use a block file on your nails instead of the drill.

"Fuck no. Do not waste your energy feeling guilty about something that's out your control. 

I've had psoriasis for 20 years. I'm 35 now. When I was younger, I smoked 30 cigarettes a day, I was  told this makes psoriasis worse so now I don't smoke at all. I used to drink five pints of lager every day. Now I don't drink alcohol. I spent a year effectively on holiday with no stress, then I had an incredibly stressful period of time when I thought my wife was going to die for weeks after child birth. I spent years getting 10 hours sleep a night then many months on only four hours. I spent three years veggie. I've cut out wheat, sugar, processed food. I did paleo for months. I've tried Barney's formula. The difference? Nothing. Not a single fucking thing. Still got psoriasis. The only thing that's ever worked for me is UV therapy and that's ""treating the symptoms not the cause"".

I look back and just think what a waste of time. This shit is genetic. It runs in families. Our cells divide incorrectly. That's it. Maybe a hardcore macrobiotic diet might do something but that's just too difficult and I've spent too long in an already short life depriving myself of a little of what I like.

I'm afraid that you've been dealt a shit hand genetically so my advice is to slap on the moisturiser, try to get some UV, naturally or otherwise. And stop feeling guilty. Life is far too short to feel guilty for shit you haven't done! Good luck, friend.",comjhc9,Psoriasis,1424043514,consumer_monkey,10,0

I've had a few online friends that it only affects a few toes, or its just a mild stiffness, and hasn't spread or had any major impact. Just like with P it seems to be all over the place in terms of severity.

Humira has things sorta ""paused"" right now in terms of progression for me, so thats good, but there's still a lot of pain, stiffness.

MTX will require regular blood work, and you'll want to take folic acid too to help prevent the side effects. Some people tolerate it really well, but its a chemo drug it has the possiblity to really mess you up.

Color removers work pretty well on permanent dyes and are a much better option than bleach, which would likely just leave you with red/orange hair. Color removers are also not damaging.

You might have to use bleach to get back to a level 9, but if you lighten it with color remover first this will be much easier.

Although keep in mind that black hair can stain light hair. If this is the case, getting back to a level 9 could be next to impossible even with bleach.",cofkxrq,Hair,1423449037,graveyardgirl,2,0

"I just recently found this subreddit too! I totally understand what you are going through. For years now I have spent uncountable nights til 3 or 4 am picking my face, the entire time thinking ""this is going to look so horrible tomorrow!!"" but unable to stop.

You will find a ton of support here that you cannot get from anyone else. Like you said, no one else really gets it. My boyfriend says the same thing as your friends. ""You know you are going to feel bad about it so why do it?"" He doesn't understand that I go into a trance and literally cannot stop myself.

I agree with the other comment that most people suffering from this have an underlying issue that needs to be dealt with. For me it is depression and anxiety do to past abuse and my parent's divorce. EVERY TIME I feel sad about these things I end up at the mirror picking for hours at a time. Even if it is only bothering me in the back of my mind.

The key is to get rid of your triggers. When I need to go pee at home I always end up looking in the mirror and picking and an hour will pass and I will suddenly realize I haven't even gone to the bathroom yet! So what helps is to not allow myself to even glance in the mirror when I use the restroom. I leave and go to the kitchen to wash my hands where there is not a mirror.

My make-up mirror is a horrible trigger also. I always sit down to ""pluck my eyebrows"" and end up picking. I have started using a regular mirror to put on makeup and pluck because once I see all those bumps up close I can never resist popping them. 

I have improved a lot since a year ago but I still pick at least a little every day and have a really bad episode once every couple of weeks.  A lot of people have suggested finding something to do if you recognize that you feel like picking before it happens. For me they said to pet my dogs since I have 2 dogs. It actually helps a lot because my dogs get sad and bark at me when I am in the mirror and ignoring them. So if I lay down and pet them and let them lick me it helps a lot.

Leave the house if you need to! Go to sonic or go to Walmart and pick up something you need for dinner. Anything to keep yourself from looking in the mirror or touching your arms. 

You will get better, I promise! Take it one day at a time. You can message me any time if you need someone to talk to before you go into an episode. Just first recognize how you feel right before you pick so that you can stop it before it happens.

"That's so great you've found a good therapist to work with. Honestly, this is probably going to have the biggest effect on your ability to get a handle on the picking. I in no way mean this in a patronising way, but WELL DONE! It's such a big step to take for a lot of people, so well done!!! :D

I completely relate to the picking to make your skin perfect. I try to challenge this with a good skincare routine. I also got some sudocrem (it's a zinc oxide cream I think. Not sure on U.S equivalents) and it heals cuts up much much faster. Dab it on with a qtip/cotton bud though as I find it can cause a breakout if I use it on skin that's ok as well. 

The things that are helping me to stick to the changes are really taking a long view. I expect this will take maybe a year or so to get down to manageable levels. Any time I freak out about that I just bring myself back to that calm approach.

Making my goals deliberately imperfect really, really helps too. The pressure of having a goal like 'stop picking my skin' is really too much. So I'm aiming to 'reduce picking my skin'. I might always do it, but it might, for the most part, be at such a low level that it doesn't bother me.

Accepting that progress won't be linear and that relapses WILL happen and that's ok, it's part of the process helps me stick to changes. I still have bad days, usually when I'm really hormonal where, no matter how much I try to distract myself or mentally say 'ok and stop now, put your hands down' I do it anyway. Instead of freaking out I am compassionate towards myself and just persist the next day. 

Picking (no pun intended) your battles with yourself is important too. Like, on a day where distraction or telling myself to gently stop isn't working, it's sometimes a good idea to give in, rather than making a big deal of it and getting yourself worked up. If it's causing too much stress, it might not be worth it.

Persistence is the key. Don't be phased by regression or ""failure"". It can happen a million times, but just persist. At some point it will start to improve. Be kind to yourself. Even if it takes 10 years, it still means you will have a future ahead of you where this isn't a problem and that's worth persisting for. 

It sounds like you're doing a lot of step by step stuff with your therapist, so be cautious about trying to make too many more changes on top of what you're already doing.

oh! I also made myself a plan. Here's a picture of a screenshot of it. You'll see this is now mostly to do with diet. The right hand column is the end point I'm trying to get to. The end points are deliberately imperfect! The other things are small, incremental and attainable, positive changes I can make. The cells in orange are the things I'm focusing on right now. The steps change as I progress through and decide what feels manageable next. 

http://i.imgur.com/Ux3NgRd.png

HAHA ignore my tooth brushing goals. I do it in the morning but evenings are tricky. This is much more of an Aspergers/executive function issue. Nearly there with that!!

"Considering you already have color in your hair I wouldn't recommend lightening it yourself. You never know how the color will react to bleach. You'd be better going to a salon for the bleaching, especially if you want blue in your hair. Blue needs a light base to get a good color. Think about your hair as paper and the dye as ink. If you put blue ink on paper that isn't white the color will be different to what you expect. If you go for pink you can get away with a little more brassy undertones in your hair. 

I go to salons and asked them to get me to a platinum blonde. That gets my hair nice and light and removes any blonde or brassy tones. Then I color my own hair at home. I like to use special effects usa and la riche directions. I buy them both online. These dyes will usually fade out after a couple of months, so for a temporary color they are a great option. They tend to look good as they fade too, so it's like having constantly changing hair color, which I love! 

If you want the dye to fade out completely I like special effects blue mayhem. I call it ""sonic blue"" because the blue reminds me of sonic the hedgehog. This dye fades out to a lilac and eventually to white. From there you have a clean slate to do whatever! 

If you want a bright pink I like special effects atomic pink. For me this dye never completely fades out. You eventually get that nice pastel pink that's really in right now. If you want to be blonde after you would have to do a bleach bath. If you want to go back to red having a pink base wouldn't be a problem. Your red would come out brighter on your lighter hair. 

If you want a lighter blue or a turquoise blue your hair needs to be as close to white as you can manage. Otherwise the yellow tones will make the color look more green. My favorite turquoise blue is by la riche directions. It tends to come out less green than other brands I've tried. This fades to a nice pastel blue, which is popular right now. I find in my hair this dye sticks around for quite a while, I usually end up bleaching it out to change color. 

I hope this helps! If you have any questions please ask. ",coawv2o,Hair,1423061401,TasteTheRainbowHead,3,0
"I did two courses when I was your age/ little younger. They knew a lot less about Accutane then. It worked ok, I spent my 20s mostly acne free. Old photos from Facebook make me smile, my skin looked so good!

I broke out again In a big way around 30. This time, I was left with pock mark scars that I hate. People tell me they're unnoticeable, but...you know how it is. 

If you're nervous about side effects, you're nervous. No one here is going to change that. My point: I would rather have had my 20s with clear skin than not. Yes, my side effects were awful at 17. Now I'm 32, and here we go again. Nosebleeds, dry lips, no alcohol. But if it helps me in the long run, it will have been worth it. 

Believe the statistics. When they say your chances are rare, it's true.

Now what happens is your bangs get a little heavy, so your stylist will want to make sure they are short enough but also angled (almost like Justin Beiber bangs).  You want it to fall across your forehead, not hang in one piece.  

Color seems fine, maybe a little dry.   You might want a less intensive shampoo and/or a more moisturizing conditioner.

I spend quite a bit of time on my hair, and much more than someone with long hair can get away with by tossing it up in a ponytail. Remember, for pixie cuts, there is no ""ponytail"" or anything similar to throw it up into when you're short on time. You either have to do it or it will look bad (for me anyway). But I wouldn't let that scare you. I LOVE my short hair and don't plan on growing it anytime soon. Also, all the cuts in the album are pretty different. Some have  bangs, some don't and the 2nd picture is more of a bob than a pixie. I would really think about what it is you want first (more specific than the pictures) and go to a salon where they're not going to rush you in and out. You'll want to really talk to the stylist and be on the same page. One more thing, you can always go shorter, but you can't ""cut your hair longer"". So, starting at a bob-length cut, maybe like the 2nd picture, would be a good way to ease you into shorter hair and then you can decide if you want it shorter into a full blown pixie.",cofhgdp,Hair,1423442510,thebossapplesauce,5,0

"I pick anywhere bumpy, scaly, dry. I've caught myself on the toilet picking out ingrown hairs on my thighs, even after I finish my business. I don't cause any lasting pain, just a bit of hyperpigmentation. Spending time in front of the mirror or just sitting there grazing is my concentration time. It's where I turn my brain off to what's in front of me and think about my life, be introspective. I could just as easily be doing something constructive at these moments like knitting or drawing, and in a way I think about picking as constructive as it's getting rid of the bump my fingers locate and it does provide an emotional release, but I remind myself that my skin would be much better off with a loofa in the shower instead of my incessant squeezing and scratching. Picking is a temporary solution that will just cause different problems like inflammation, scabs, scars, hyperpigmentation.

 Maybe I don't have full-blown CSP because unlike the sidebar mentions I don't feel irritated if I don't let myself pick (but I do have to remind myself of my justifications and catch myself from mindlessly doing it anyway). Maybe my case is milder or maybe I'm wrong and like a smoker I only think I can stop any time. No matter what though I have to think of the long-term: did picking out something like this last time really help, or did it cause the bump to flare up even more?

"Oh, boy. First of all, I do not know anything about black henna specifically, but the natural henna that dyes red is my forte. First, boil some tea and/or instant coffee until the water reduces a bit and, you know, the tea and/or coffee is strong. Add the henna powder to it and make a thick paste. Make sure it's not watery. Leave it overnight to ferment overnight. The tea/coffee is a conditioner for the hair and it deepens the color.

Then, wear gloves before you use hands to apply it to your hair, otherwise your skin will be dyed. Which isn't a problem, henna usually fades within a week, or even quicker on hands because hands are so often washed with soap, etc.

Keep the henna in your hair for at least two hours for best results. It will be clumpy and the smell isn't my favorite, but it washes out great. You can also use shampoo if you prefer, but henna doesn't damage or dirty the hair, especially in your case, since you're just doing the ends. I do in on my roots too, and there it's easier to wash it out with shampoo to guarantee there isn't any henna flake I've missed.

If you have leftover henna paste, apply it again the next day. My mother usually does two applications like that and the color is deep, rich, and longlasting. Additionally, there really isn't a downside, since henna itself is a powerful hair conditioner.

"1.  Depends on how often you do, and how light you need to go, and how well you take care of your hair.  Bleach is damaging, but it often isn't too bad if you aren't trying to go black to blonde or something like that.

2. Bleach or colour?  Bleach is permanent - you've taken the colour out of your hair.  Colour, on the other hand, is very variable depending on what is used, what colour, how often you wash your hair, etc.  Most people with all over colours that don't like roots showing re-do it every 4-6 weeks.

3.  None really, except damage to your hair.  If done by a professional it's pretty much nil.

4. Yup.

5. Depends - in order to get the colours in the top photo you are going to have to lighten quite a bit, which may mean bleaching your hair more than once.  If you don't care too much about damage it could be done in a day, but I don't recommend it.  That being said, it still shouldn't take more than a couple weeks doing it properly.

6. They would look awesome on you!

7. It really depends on what exactly you decide on, but they would bleach your hair (once or twice most likely, possibly on seperate days.)  After that they would dye your hair with your chosen shade.

A lot depends on the mixing process for the henna (lemon juice, warm - not hot!!! - water, etc). Indigo actually does not really bind to the hair, which is why you need to apply henna first. Otherwise it will fade out very rapidly! Always wear gloves as well since henna colors well. Also it takes a while to achieve the final color so don't be scared if it has a greenish/blueish shine, this SHOULD disappear. If it doesn't overnight, reapply cause removing henna is quite a hassle.

"My first question would be the same as onawednesday's. If they used a razor (especially if they used it improperly) your hair shafts could be damaged. That's the main reason we don't use razors for the actualy cutting in the salon where I work. We mainly use them on neck lines to soften them up on shorter hair cuts (think women's pixie cuts, we don't want to use clippers to make that line super solid and maybe masculine, the razor softens it up)

The other thing could be the type of blade (scissors) they used. In this salon, we utilize Rusk blades and cutting techniques. They have 3 different sets of texturizing blades. If the stylist taking care of you using texturizing blades improperly, your hair will be left feeling dry/damaged/broken. 

Do you heat style your hair (blow dry, flat iron, curl)? If so, make sure you're using a protectant. 

If your hair is actually damaged, try looking for something to help get you through to the next hair cut, try doing a deep conditioner once a week (my favorite is Redken's extreme line!) or use a leave in treatment for when you blow dry (try Redken's Extreme Anti Snap, it'll work wonders!)

"Yes there is a such thing as a pediatric dermatologist, and yes, you should consider seeing one. 

This is a entirely superficial (no deep component) infantile hemangioma in a cosmetically sensitive location. Yes, this is *somewhat* small, and the natural history is to gradually, spontaneously involute. But they are capable of ""rapid growth"" periods. And while most rapid growth periods *usually* occur between 1-2 months of age, not all of these read the textbooks. This past Monday I saw an IH the size of a baseball on the upper chest of a 10 month old female, that still somehow didn't get referred early enough. 

There are treatment options. Chief among them is a relatively safe, old-school antihypertensive medication, propanolol (beta blocker), that was discovered serendipitously to work VERY well for halting growth and promoting involution of IH's when used for a period of months. While the systemic form is the most effective, it likely won't be indicated because your child's lesion is fairly small. But, there are even safer, topical analogues (ointment/gel) that some pediatric dermatologists think useful for superficial lesions like your baby's.

This is your baby's *face*, and you have been misinformed in being told that there's nothing that can be done. Continue taking photos and consider requesting a pediatric dermatology referral.",coboa12,Dermatology,1423107710,Rare_Air,2,0

"Tanning beds are banned in a lot of places yet you can still buy cigarettes. That kind of puts me off them. The big problem with them is the risk is cumulative and people use them a lot when they are young and vain and you have young people dieing of something that is completely preventable.

If you can get treatment at a skin clinic/dermatologist with narrowband UVB you will hit that psoriasis much harder, still get a bit of a tan and while it likely has some skin cancer risk you are only getting the frequency of rays you need without the do-nothing rays that add risk for no benefit. How much safer it is I have no idea.

And with that said, I am about to head outside to the Aussie summer heat and soak up some midday carcinogens. I take a timer and never burn but with my pale skin type most dermatologists would probably be gasping at the thought. Because fuck it, you only live once, and if you live long enough you are going to die of cancer but better than living your whole life with psoriasis. At least having psoriasis we tend to know what is happening on our skin and most visit dermatologists and non-melanoma cancers tend to have a decent prognosis with early detection. Melanoma is scary, scary stuff though. Still even biologics with all their carefully targetted goodness have some scary warnings.

"I am also 22 and I've suffered with this for 12.  I have scars on my shoulders from a very bad phase, directly caused by my CSP.  I have always been very timid about showing my arms and for the longest time I felt the absolute dire need to have some fringe on my head because my forehead was always a mess.  

I recently took a job that requires me to have *all* of my hair protected, which means my forehead is exposed and it still bothers me.  I have a *very* red spot, I managed to dig very deep into that has not healed for months.  It's hard to miss, and everyone keeps asking me if I walked into a cupboard door.  I like their version better.

But what really, truly is the bane of my confidence is that my trouble spot seems to be my nipples.  I don't know why I do it any more than someone else with CSP.  I fear my breasts are scarred beyond repair and when I see another breast, perfect and untouched it just makes me feel worse.  My boobs look like they have a breakout of hives, I have bloodied spots all over.  They are ugly.  I feel terrible even letting my boyfriend see them (bless his heart he has never said anything about it!!)

"Interesting. I have tried goat cheese and it's delicious and I have never had a problem with it. I also replaced regular milk with almond milk and that stuff is great. Growing up I always had milk and cheese without a problem. About two years ago I decided I was going to lose some weight. I completely cut out dairy products because they are high in calories and you can live without them. So after being on the diet for a year(ish) I decided to drink a milkshake and basically relapse for a bit. When I drank the milkshake about 30 minutes later I would have diarrhea for about an hour and a half to two hours. Same thing if I ate a pizza or anything dairy really. Now a days if i have it i just get really gaseous. Havent tried a milkshake in a while im too scared lol. Do you think you can become lactose intolerant by going with out lactose for a while?

depending on your hair length you could always try to dye like an inch of the ends of your hair, leave it for about a month and then see how it fades to get an idea if its a good idea, and if not then just get a little trim and you dont have to worry about ruining a whole head of hair..",cohxp56,Hair,1423637968,ilove_Gingers,1,0

"I applaud your curiosity and your being proactive, but I agree with pimms4london.

Fibroblasts are cells within the dermis that generate, maintain, and repair connective tissue. They also produce proteins that make up the support matrix for all the surrounding cells.

Fibroblasts are spindle cells, like many other benign and malignant tumors. ""Spindle/spindled"" simply refers to the shape of the cell. That's it. Identifying the spindle morphology on a pathology specimen is not enough to conclude (1) what type of cell it is or (2) what it's doing. It's just a clue, and there are many others. For example: Where are the cells located? Are the nuclei irregular? Are the cells dividing rapidly? Are they forming normal structures? Are they forming any identifiable structures at all? Is the tissue dying? Are they invading adjacent tissues? Are they making the expected cell surface proteins? Et cetera. The list goes on and on and on depending on the type of tissue. And that's not even accounting for the valuable clues that come from how the lesion behaves clinically (i.e. symptoms, size, shape, growth, color, location, texture, depth). 

Dermatopathologists are highly trained to identify these myriad patterns, correlate them with the clinical behavior, and decide what's worrisome and what isn't. None of them could make that call on one finding alone (e.g. the presence of spindled cells), and none of them could stay in business taking the time to report out every single finding they see under the microscope. The report you have is a summary; there's far, far more nuance to their analysis than it reveals.

Like you, I started breaking out around 8/9. Now at 21, I've tried every possible solution, all with no avail. I'm on accutane now and just wish that I had been able to find a doctor to prescribe to me sooner. My skin really wasn't ever bad but the oiliness and big congested pores, along with the monthly breakout, were just too much for me! Now here I am on the cusp of adulthood, and I look like a 13 year old boy that refuses to wash his face. Well, not since starting accutane a few months ago, but you get what I mean. 

Yes it's a harsh drug, but the side effects, though potentially severe, are much less frequent than many people in this sub will lead you to believe. You can check this in clinical studies. I'm on my third month at the highest dose that is allowed for my weight, and the worst side effect I've seen is the occasional nosebleed. My skin isn't even dry. 

I know you weren't looking for advice or my opinion, but I just think that reconsidering pursuing accutane if you've had acne since you were so young (meaning maybe its less about hormonal and more that you just have really oily skin like I did) rather than trying drug after drug that doesn't work, and allowing your face to scar.

"Hey, I did something that has been fairly helpful to me, especially when I start picking and then all of a sudden it could turn into a binge. I wrote three categories on my mirror of binge, regular, and none. At the end of every day I would write the date under whichever category of picking I had done that day. Not picking is hard, but I managed to not pick 15 days last month. Some consecutive, most not. But the important part was that I could see exactly which days and exactly how many. And having the differentiation between regular picking (one or two spots) and binging made it so that even if I did start I would think, no, I don't want to have to write this day in the binge chart. I ended up with two binge days in January. My goal is to get even more non picking days this month. And, for the love of sanity, please stop leaning in closer to mirrors.

"Hey, as of a couple days ago the sensationail gel kit was on sale at Walgreens.com for $39, with free shipping. You can also get the Sally Hansen kit for the same price on Amazon. I know it's not exactly cheap but it's enough for 10 manicures before buying more polish, which makes it significantly cheaper than actual manicures. 

I actually used a Walgreens coupon to buy the lamp separately from the primer+base/topcoat from their site because I only wanted clear polish and buying them separately actually provided more product and for cheaper, so you could do that too.

I've been finding that keeping my nails as short as possible, which usually doesn't prevent me from picking, and putting gel on actually physically prevents my nails from getting traction on my skin, which is wonderful. Even if I try to pick I can't do any damage, and not being able to pick takes the joy out of it so I'm finding I touch my face less and less which is helping my skin heal this further reducing the textural spots I would pick up on.

"Stop stop! You are doing better. Just think, in the last month you've picked SO much less than you have done in a long time. Don't take that achievement away from yourself. You're not at square one. Progress with this is NOT linear. All you need to do, when you have a bad day is write it off, remind yourself how well you're doing when you think more long-term and then try again tomorrow. 

Imagine over the course of this year, if you managed the sort of level of picking you've had/not had over the last month, including the day you picked, how much better that is for your skin?! 

For some people, picking may always be a temptation or a behaviour that rears it's head at times of stress, change, etc, but learning skills to manage this urge is the key. Sometimes you might do it. It's not the end of the world if you do. You just want to build up to getting it to a level where it doesn't get your down. 

Also, a lot of people pick their skin at the frequency that you have over the past month (including the day you picked). This is within the normal range. Don't aim for perfect. Perfectionism is the fast route to killing all sense of achievement and self-esteem.

"Looking online at the ingredients for the John Frieda, I would say it is nothing like a color really and just more like a conditioner.  The dimethicone, and really anything ending in -cone add shine.  I would say probably don't use it TOO often, as sometimes products containing dimethicone and especially silicone can build up on the hair.  If you do, I would use a clarifying shampoo every other or every two times you shampoo.

As to the ion, I think it's something similar.  Looking at the directions I could find online, it didn't appear to require a developer.  The reviews online that said it seemed to damage their hair, it could be that they have product buildup that is preventing their conditioner from penetrating the hair and actually doing its thing, thus causing dryness.  So it can't really HURT your hair, but you might find you need to use a clarifying treatment if you get a buildup.

"I work in a lab and last summer came down with exzema on a few fingers, and I think it's because rather than wear gloves (usually latex for me) I prefer to wash my hands OFTEN (dozen or more times a day, just at work) which probably exacerbates it just as much. I found a few products that really kept it at bay: 

Aveeno 1% hydrocortisone anti-itch cream (found at my Kroger supermarket in the first-aid section) - it's not as greasy as other hydrocortisone creams; I found (and many do, as you may have) that you can build up a sort of tolerance to it, so use sparingly or in between other moisturizer sessions. Otherwise it's very nice. A little more expensive than the other brands, but the lotion base is much much nicer. 

Aveeno Eczema Therapy cream - found at Target.  It's somewhat expensive, but AWESOME.  A little goes a long way.  This is not a medicated cream (so no steroids) but this has really been the resolution for me. As soon as I feel anything, I put a dab on. Seriously, can't recommend this enough.

Good call on the pineapple - pineapple contains bromelain, a protease (meat tenderizer), and is one of a few [fruits associated with latex allergy] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latex_allergy).  

One thing I've noticed with my problem and handwashing is that the more I dry my hands, the *less* irritated they get.  I think it may have something to do with the physical effects of evaporation on half-dried skin. Just a theory. The reason I don't like to wear gloves is that sweat is just as irritating and exacerbates dermatitis. I think keeping your hands dry is really important, and gloves mostly keep you stewing in your own juices.

Are you obligated to wear gloves in the kitchen (I imagine legally you are)? If vinyl and nitrile are bothering you, a latex glove is likely to be irritating as well; I'm not aware of a fourth option that would qualify for food prep. If you can reduce glove time to just things like pineapple/meat, that may help; combine that with keeping dry and you may be on the road to recovery.

Come to think of it, powdered gloves used to be really common - you could try, as an experiment, dusting your hands with a little gold bond or talcum powder (unscented, for sensitive skin, etc) before applying gloves.  That might help - or it might make things worse, I'm not sure. Just a thought.

Good luck. For me it's a been a LONG way back - still suffering a little.  You really have to stay on top of it.

"'medium brown' to me means you would be around a level 4 or 5 and the copper in the picture you posted is at about a 6 or a 7. You should only need 20vol on your hair.  (not sure if the salon is a Redken exclusive salon but that's the brand I work with so it's kinda perfect! I've also worked with Davines.) Be sure you let your stylist know that you're NOT happy with the vibrance of the colour. As much as we would love to be: we're not mind readers! :) sometimes our clients are nervous to tell us they don't like the colour because you don't want to be rude, but honestly, your head is our advertising and if our clients aren't happy WE aren't happy =D! 

Magnetics is a GREAT shampoo for colour. However, it IS heavy especially if you have fine hair! You don't have to use the conditioner. Your plan of using the Magnetics shampoo and the Alchemic conditioner sounds perfect and that's exactly what I would prescribe for you. The Alchemic conditioner should be enough  colour deposit. (usually colour deposit shampoos and conditioners are only a bandaid and they won't really deposit a SIGNIFICANT amount of colour. They will simply ensure your colour STAYS a little better if that makes sense!) 

I'm not sure if your salon uses Davenis colour or Redken colour. If they use Redken colour, ask if they have Shades EQ Gloss. At that point, your stylist should be depositing a shade very similar to the permanent (or demi permanent) colour they use initially. The gloss will sit on at the sink for about 15 minutes and it simply locks in the colour and adds a little more vibrance. (I'm sorry, I can't remember the colour lines in Davines as it's been a little while since I've worked with the line! But if they work with Davines, just ask your stylist if you can glaze your colour once you're done with another copper tone to lock in the colour, they should understand what you mean).

"I didn't notice much of an initial breakout, at least not as bad as some make out.

Do not and I repeat DO NOT pop your pimples whilst on accutane. Don't touch your face in general. Don't even rub your skin too vigorously with a towel. When you're on this drug, your skin is just hyper fucking sensitive. That pimple you wouldn't flinch at popping? It's now 10x more sore and leaves a worse mark. It's just not worth it. Don't get me wrong, there will be the odd occasion where you just need to get rid of a problem spot, but don't go about poking your face as you normally would. I found I would actually get the equivalent of a ""carpet burn"" on my face if I rubbed it too hard with a towel.

How quickly you see results seems to vary. I honestly noticed an improvement in weeks. I could see and feel the drug working. Was I still hideous? Yes, but it was doing something! A very noticeable improvement for me was made after roughly 2 to 3 months. I'm now on month 5 and I'm almost completely clear. The key here is patience.

You can buy at-home kits and fillers to either dye all of your hair or just the regrowth (your roots).

"Bear in mind that there's a possibility that he may never accept that it's not just a bad habit. Obviously, to us, if it was just a bad habit we would have stopped by now because we all know how bad it is for us physically and emotionally. But it's not that simple, which is exactly why it's not ""just a bad habit"" and more like an addiction. I have tried to explain this to my mother and she won't accept that it is a real disorder and considers the label an excuse to keep on doing it (as if I weren't trying not to). At this point, I just make it a point to try not to pick a few days leading up to seeing her and being extra careful with my makeup application and making sure she never sees my face without makeup. Which is sad, but that's the only way I can get her off my case.

Which brings me to my point: negative feedback does more harm than good. I would have a serious talk with him and explain that you know it is bad but that it is a condition which is harder to get over than just a bad habit. Then suggest to him that you work on it together to help you break it. Tell him that instead of berating you for picking, give you positive feedback when he notices that you aren't picking or that a blemish is disappearing because you've picked at it less. I always responded to negative feedback from my mother/friends/bf negatively, as it just makes me feel bad and possibly resentful, creating tension in the relationship. Meanwhile, positive feedback is more powerful at creating habits, and focusing on the positives instead of the negatives will make you feel a hell of a lot better day to day.

"Going to a dermatologist is the best thing you can do and it's a great first step. You and your derma may have to try a variety of different things to find out what works and what doesn't. Lots of things can help it from inside and out such as changing your diet to drinking more water to experimenting with creams to varying your daily sun exposure.

I totally understand how you feel. I have facial psoriasis on my forehead, my nose, and my jawline. Several years ago at my worst, I didn't want to go out anywhere. I had to wear a hat to cover the aggressively red and dry crusting plaques on my hairline and the rest of my hair to cover my face. I could barely look anyone in the eye. I felt like a monster. I was diagnosed around the same age as you and after trying a couple of dermatologists, I finally found one who prescribed me the right steroid and ointment, and it wasn't until several years later with **a lot** of experimentation with my diet and moisturizing creams, potions, and lotions that I finally saw significant improvement!

I changed my diet from mostly junk food to more veggies and less sugar and carbs. I started building up a daily skincare routine based around heavy moisturizing and hydration. From at my worst to now, the difference has been *incredible* and no one could ever even tell I had a skin condition unless I point out specific spots. It's not totally gone by any means, but every morning I wake up, rinse off the creams and aquaphor I put on the night before, and be absolutely in awe at the fact my skin is the way it is today.

There's hope. It's absolutely possible to manage it. It sucks, it truly, absolutely fucking sucks. The key is to keep persevering to try to find something that works. Since psoriasis is not as cut and dry as other conditions, you might even find yourself switching dermatologists let alone prescriptions to treat it. 

You might feel gross and disgusting, but don't let it get in the way of taking care of the rest of you. **You** are not gross. You just got a bad card when it came to the skin game. And you know what? In my experience, people only really notice as much attention as you bring to it. Good people understand it's something you never asked for and will overlook it if you carry on.

"Stop stressing about it. It only makes it worse. I am an old lady so I will give you a couple of tips that have worked for me. 
*use lotion, non scented, non greasy. I like ""Uremol 10"" it replenishes the urea in your skin. Costly but worth it.
*watch your diet. Somethings will trigger a flare up. For me it's food with tomatoes and high acid fruit like pineapple.
*I found prescription cortisone ointment worked the best (for me anyway)
*have a bath instead of a shower, hot chlorine hammering against dry skin will irritate.
*stay away from suncreen, you need the bad sun rays. Use common sense as to how much exposure you should have and cover your skin.
*buy sunflower oil from the grocery store. After your in the tub apply it to your wet skin. After a few minutes, lightly scratch the dead skin off your sores. When you get out wipe off and apply precrip cream. Dead skin will not allow cream to penetrate. CAUTION: oil on the bottom of your may cause you to fall.
*sit in front of a sunny window in the winter to get sun exposure to your sores.
*Be happy, laughter is the best medicine.
*Experiment,with different things, something as simple as a teaspoon of coconut oil a day may help you immensely.
*prescription creams/ointments are a must but please stay away from prescription pills

"I noticed knee pain when I was about 16 or 17. It got slowly worse over the next 8 or so years and the last 2 years it seems to have gotten much worse much faster. More and more joints started to hurt. My back started hurting--I thought I had mysteriously injured it somehow without noticing the injury, but only noticing the pain.

For the most part I just work through the pain. I've found that most joints will hurt less if I use them up to a point--beyond that point I start to head down hill, aggravating my joints, rather than exorcising them. 

There are several other drugs that are more potent and will likely work for me even if methotrexate doesn't, so I have not given up.


EDIT: Let me be more explicit. You don't loose function of you joints; you gain pain. (Inflamation *may* limit *some* of your normal range/movement) The pain makes you want to not use your joints and less you use your joints, the more they deteriorate and the more pain you will be in. So it's a downward spiral. You have to work through the pain--medication makes it easier to do that.",coo46e3,Psoriasis,1424183168,deusnefum,1,0
"It's rarer to have no skin symptoms at all, or to develop after joint problems, but it's not unheard-of. For example, I have PsA in a couple of joints, and one big reason, I now understand, it took several (7) years to get the diagnosis was because I didn't have clear psoriasis, and PsA without psoriasis was so rare the doctors apparently were not able to make the connection, but only tested for RA, and when the test were always negative, told me ""not to worry, it'll go away in time""...

Only afterwards, when knowing what to look for, I found some very mild coloration in one toe nail, and a tiny one-square-centimeter-sized persistent ""rash"" under my hair that I (and many doctors) for long thought was something else. And neither of them got any worse over time when I didn't have medication , and now that I have (metotrexate), they are slowly getting better and better.

The blackheads you describe are most likely sebaceous filament. A myth perpetuated by the cosmetic industry. Try giving a read of the lymphatic system on Wikipedia. I bet you have problems and pick in areas where the system expels outwards rather than inwards. 

I would start by jotting down some sort of note every time you pick. Maybe even just a tally in the corner of a a page. Try to include how you are feeling and try to figure out why you are picking. A big one for me is actually pleasure (I tug gently at beard hairs and that irritates the skin and I will pick and pull hairs from that area). Frustration,  stress,  deadlines,  procrastipicking etc. Write it all down. 

Try looking at the benefits of NAC (N-Acystaliene or something similar). It could be great (or just the right amount of placebo to help you). I personally feel like it helps.

"So since the hydrocortisone did nothing, and there's new lesions popping up, I would recommend you get a punch biopsy done. 

You would have to call your dermatologist to ask about the cost. There's usually a separate cost for the biopsy itself as well as another one for the dermatopathologist to analyze the lesion.

Ir's important to let them biopsy for the freshest lesion possible and NOT an old resolving one, or else the biopsy will have been for nothing. 

I can see you're worried about a lot of different outcomes at this point, but this is the best possible advice I can offer. I wouldn't waste anymore time or money on OTC regimens. Even if the cost is $300, would that be worth peace of mind for you? Only you can answer that.

I also use Dovonex, Taclonex and Ultravate (rotating, not at the same time) as topical (steroids) after the spray dries.

"Lotions are pretty watery/weak, in my experience. Even when my P was mild/medium-ish, I was on a super heavy moisturiser. Not kidding, it had the viscosity of goose fat (but on the plus side without the greasiness). 

There are plenty of commercial moisturisers out there to try, but just be aware that the people that they are targeted at are those with regular, everyday dry skin - nothing as severe as full-on eczema, dermatitis, P etc. They won't be nearly as strong or as long-lasting as what you'd find in the less attractive pots in a pharmacy, though they'll smell much nicer and feel a lot less sticky on your hands and skin.

If it's that severe, perhaps at least trial some of the thicker non-cosmetic stuff. If that's not for you (too unpleasant or whatever), then I suggest the Aveeno range of ""mainstream"" moisturisers. The shea butter one smells great, isn't sticky and keeps the skin well moisturised for a very respectable part of the day, even when rubbing on the inside of tight jeans, which can be quite dry. Otherwise, their regular daily moisturising cream is pretty good too - light, neutral and surprisingly effective for its consistency.

Good luck.

I went from having as high as 90% skin coverage to 5-10% coverage.  Alas, I never was 100% clear.  My elbows always had scales, albeit smaller patches.

I know this is off-topic from your question, but here goes.  Last year, I started Stelara.  My dermatologist explained that it was a biologic that worked similarly to Enbrel and Humira, but it targeted earlier cell production (or something like that).  The nice thing was that I only needed one injection every 12 weeks (after an initial 4- or 6-week phase).  This was wonderful since I hate needles.

My case may be unique, but only with Stelara have I ever been 100% clear of psoriasis patches.  I stopped taking it November 2013 because my husband and I wanted to have a baby.

"I'll just put my updates here in the comments. 

DAY 1 SUCCESS! Though that's nothing to celebrate. Usually the main reason I can get through the 24 hour mark is because my face is in too much pain to pick. Today is partially that again, but just with that one spot that I had the bandaid on yesterday. But that spot is bad enough to make the theory apply. 

However I experienced 2 new things today which contributed to my success..first was right in the morning I noticed myself leaning in to put mascara on and I hadn't realized my disease took advantage of that moment to cause my eyes to wander. With my hands so close to my face..  you know where that goes. So I stood straight to apply my mascara with no additional difficulty than when my nose is a foot from the glass.

The other major thing I experienced was a mental shift. I was driving home thinking about whether or not I would be able to deal with not picking the scab off that one bad spot. (it's a poorly developed scab so make-up looks crappy on it..and it's starting to crack and itch which makes me self conscious that it might randomly start bleeding. That would be deadly embarrassment. Usually I can pick the scab off and over night it'll turn into a smoother scab...But every single time it also results in more picking...because the disease is trying to find any excuse to keep me going. Obviously my body is the expert at how to heal..wtf do I know how to regenerate skin. But that's definitely the strongest false story in my mind which causes me to fail repeatedly.)
So while I was contemplating my options for dealing with the upcoming mental battle when I had my evening shower..a little thought cut through all the rest. ""But I want tomorrow to be day 2 not day 1 again."" See in my original post where I said I didn't know if tomorrow (today) would be day one or not? That's because I predicted this battle and the scab that I would want to pick off and the inevitable downward spiral. I figured I'd still be able to meet my goal of 10 days before vacation and get one last pick in. I didn't anticipate my determination to be so much stronger than before! Normally I just give in to those thoughts but not tonight! 

Now there is a toss up about whether or not I have added motivation because tomorrow I have to go to the dentist...and the bad spot is on my jaw line..part of me says picking would make me feel less anxious about that...But a surprising larger part of me says no I'd feel more anxious if I picked and possibly caused my make up to not stick (because sometimes that previous method I explained about creating a smoother scab doesn't work out). At least today I got through the day without a ridiculous amount of anxiety about how bad the spot looked. Probably because the rest of my face is doing so much better from my recent non-consecutive days of success.

.....(I also had awesome sex which got rid of the anxiety that had been building up on my drive home...my boyfriend surprised me with candles...sometimes random things happen for a reason.)

So all in all it was a good day. A definite success. Tomorrow I'll comment about the therapist stuff that 2 people have commented about. It's the 48 hour mark that for some reason has been a ridiculous barrier for me so I'll be typing to distract myself. ",coajya4,CompulsiveSkinPicking,1423020565,angiesboots,2,0

"Shampoo is a totally unnatural substance that nobody really used prior to the 1950's.

All shampoo does is severely dry out the skin causing your scalp to over-produce oil and throw the whole system out of whack.

Before I stopped using shampoo, chunks, literally chunks of scalp would fall off of me.  Now that I use only hot (as I can stand it) water, my scalp problems diminished by 90%.

A great side-effect of going back to water only (like the human race has done since we crawled out of the mud bog), is that the hair takes on a beautiful, lustrous sheen and becomes much more soft and supple.  No problems with overly oily hair, as the scalp remains in balance and stops over-producing oil.

"My skin has been a wreck since I was 15, so I know exactly where you are coming from with your feelings of insecurity. Everything people have said so far in this thread is fantastic advice, but I just wanted to drop in to offer some insight I've found helpful as I've figured my shit out.

I can tell you honestly, any and every girl I have been with since I was first diagnosed has been 100% cool with it and has been nothing but supportive. Ive even had a few ladies tell me they thought it was sexy?? 

The ones who do care.... Well fuck them. Better to get that out of the way upfront then find out what a shallow person they are once you've become emotionally invested. Those people are not worth your time.

As I'm sure you've experienced, people who ask if something is wrong with your skin are only concerned for you or curious and are not coming from a place of malice. Though I've sometimes wondered myself how some can lack such tact,  Try to have a witty line prepared in case..  I've always liked..

""Hey Man..What's wrong with your skin??"" 

""Well let me tell you... you've should of seen the other guy..""
""Meth man.. Not even once.. ""    
Or even..
""You know.. it was a tough one.. But it was worth it to save every one of those orphans from that fire....""

If you have a sense of humor about it, no one can bring you down.

I can also tell you the best thing that worked for me in the winter when your skin is at your worse, is to find a convenient tanning saloon and go 3 times a week.. Work your time in the booth up and you'll be amazed at how fast it clears up!  It will also make you feel better as you will absorb much needed vitamin D!  (I know it can be a little time consuming, but it's so worth it the investment!) 

This isn't the worst thing that could happen to you, and if you don't let it get the better of you, it will only make you stronger and more confident!  

Like others have said..  Check your diet, work out, take your vitamins, and just don't let it get to you!

I've found I can eat some cheeses - the more aged the better (think parmesean etc) as aging removes some of the lactose.

 For some reason, even though it's not aged, feta is fine for me - likely because it's sheep/goat. They produce less lactose in their milk and it's more easily digestible, so it might be an alternative for you to try. 

When I miss milk for drinking I also like flavored kefir because the process keeps the lactose in check, though I try not to have that often, as it's usually awfully high in sugar.

I think what finally helped was getting on birth control and going to college and taking my meds only when I needed them. Without he medicine running through my veins I calmed down and stopped destroying my face by distracting myself with other things. 

I did pick the skin off the bottom of my feet for a long time. Sometimes until it bleed and then some. That finally came to an end when I got a serving job and was on my feet all day and couldn't stand the pain. 

As a young professional I do take my meds every day which causes me to pick sometimes but just getting my skin under control really is what helped me stop. If I had nothing to pick then I was ok.

"Antibiotics can help prevent infection. However, long-term use of antibiotics can contribute to antibiotic resistant bacteria, and if you end up with those on your face, you will be SOL. And god-forbid they are the flesh-eating variety (and these do live on your skin).

I used antibiotic ointment on my face, a LOT, growing up, and I'm at a point where certain spots on my jawline are prone to massive infection just from touching my face, even when there are no visible wounds and even if I put antibiotics on the spots at the first sign of infection. I now regret the amount of antibiotics I use to plaster on my picking spots, as I suspect that I have colonies of antibiotic resistance.

And please, don't just plaster antibiotics on your face. If you must, selectively use it, with bandaids, if you have an open wound and can't stop touching it, because it will be prone to infection. And if anything, the petroleum jelly in the antibiotic ointment will clog pores and cause acne -- I often break out around the area where I apply it, which leads to more picking.

If you want to prevent infection, I would honestly avoid wearing makeup as well, particularly if you reuse your brushes without sterilizing them, or are using liquid foundation.

Facials can be a good way to discourage you from touching your face though. Yogurt and oats can be a good one, plus the beneficial bacteria in the yogurt may help prevent infection. Yogurt is also very mildly acidic which can help exfoliate your skin.",coeiae1,CompulsiveSkinPicking,1423353493,JamesTiberiusChirp,5,0

I was just so hesitant to talk to a a man about it that I got a female therapist.  My therapist is a professor at a University Hospital in my area.  They are up on everything because they use their cases as teaching tools,  You don't see the students and it is totally confidential,  You get really good care that way and also in that setting there is peer review.  My therapist specialize in OCD spectrum disorders. These professors take patients.  My psychiatrist is at the same location, also a professor who takes cases.  I am on antidepressants which a psychiatrist must prescribe and monitor.  Both of my docs are women.  There is a lot of shame among the women with this disorder so talking to a female is easier to me.  

As to your dogs, animals get lonely for our attention and I always felt guilty when I picked because my cat would look at me so sadly and fall asleep next to me as I picked away for hours and hours, three times over night...wow..sad..three all nighters in absolute hell..the time went by so quickly because I was trying and trying to fix my skin. I was in that trance.   who knows how long I would have gone on if I did not have to get my son up for school.  He saved me.  It took along while. My kitty lost a lot of my attention and it affected her quality of life.   When I stopped to pet her she was so happy and I felt so happy too.  There is such richness in life that the picking takes away from us.  There is such comfort and peace concentrating on your pet.  It will become easier and easier for you to break out of the picking cycle the more and more you do it.  

I have an adopted ten year old son.  Only he at first could break me out of a cycle because mother love is so strong.  I have had him since he was one and I hid the picking from him.  I only picked when he was not in the same room with me.  But still I feel terribly guilty.  But he is fine and a big incentive for me to stop was not to pass these actions to him.  Children mimic their parents.  I started this because my father picked his arms and head so badly that he had open sores that he opened up again in front of me.

There are many techniques used to attach the extension to the hair:some people wrap the extension tightly around the hair, some people begin to braid the both the hair and extension piece together from the scalp, and some use a twisting method to get the extension to remain tight. After it is firmly latched onto the hair at the scalp, that is when you start to braid down. I have very thick and curly hair, so it doesn't take much to get the extension to stay tight.

It was really helpful.  Since he's read that, I've had my longest span of not picking (three months, ending in September, unfortunately), because I don't feel anxious with him telling me to stop.

In a lot of cases, reactions from our significant others like these are actually out of love.  For my boyfriend, it is actually painful for him to watch me make myself bleed.  He wants me to stop for me, and not for himself.  He thought that making a big deal of it was the right way to disrupt the behavior.  He was wrong, but I couldn't explain why without that article (I've also showed it to friends who do things like slapping my hands away when I start.)

"Sounds like you do have CSP. If you don't want to do it, but find yourself doing it anyway, then yes, sounds like you're in the right place!

Don't worry. There are things you can do. It's something that requires patience and taking a relaxed approach. It's not your fault, it's not going to kill you and if you approach it right, you can make changes that will result in you either stopping it entirely or making this an occasional thing you do when there's more stress than usual. As a starting point, have a look at my post about things that helped me:

http://www.reddit.com/r/CompulsiveSkinPicking/comments/2tpk82/how_ive_improved_my_skin_picking/

The advice may seem like making some big steps to tackling it. The sooner you accept that this is not something that can be overcome by willpower, even though it appears to be just a bad habit, the sooner you can get on with trying things on my list, the sooner you will get to a point where you feel in control of it. It's a tricky and more serious situation that you need to take seriously in order to tackle it. The behaviour itself isn't too serious but the psychology behind what's driving that behaviour is very powerful and the causes are often much bigger or broader than you think. Like someone said, it's often linked to anxiety, which can either be from things that have happened in the past or more simply because of big life changes or things in your environment that aren't working for you.

With regards to your partner. The best thing you can do, is, once you have a good understanding of what this is yourself, is to maybe show him some information to try and communicate what it is. Then, whenever he tells you to stop, tell him that him saying that isn't helpful, please could he try to refrain from saying it because it makes you feel stressed or bad about yourself. You could reiterate that you've researched this and you're taking steps to improve it.

Keep the mindest on 'improving' the behaviour rather than stopping as well. If you have been doing better, then have a bad day, just move on. Keep calm! :)

"   Hi!  Any mirror is my number 1 trigger.  If I get close enough to any mirror, I start studying myself and then I will pick.  I am in remission now so I can stop myself quickly.  But getting close to the mirror will always be a 100% trigger for me unless I can make myself step back in time to prevent the cycle from taking hold.  I used a black Permanent marker to blacken all my hand mirrors.  I only use one full length mirror to do my hair and make up but you can get make up on a foot from the mirror and that way I can't see my skin.  I also wrote TRIGGER! BACK OFF!"" on the front and back of that mirror in big letters.  ( I keep the mirror turned around unless I need to use it for dressing.) 
    Also, if I have certain spots that I might touch and pick again and again and not let heal, I put a bandaid on it the minute I get home. I use cover up when I am out.  I use bandaids that are hard to get off like fabric ones. Touching skin, scanning for bumps was also a big trigger for me.  That's the reason for the bandaids.

Then an acquaintance said, ""I take 5,000 iu of vitamin D per day in the winter (some smaller amount in the summer)."" I thought it sounded kooky, especially since my *doctor* recommended 1,000.

I'd advise doing big braids for your first time, because smaller ones can take up to two days if you're a beginner.
